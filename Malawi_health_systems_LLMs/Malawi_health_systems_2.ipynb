FOREWORD In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) together with technical partners adopted a strategy for developing and implementing comprehensive public health surveillance and response systems in African countries, initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS). However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats.  The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi subsequently adapted in 2014. Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. Emerging and re-emerging diseases and conditions pose a threat to the country’s health security.  Responding to health emergencies remains a major challenge, as shown by recent health emergencies in the country as well as the African region, the unprecedented Ebola Virus Disease of 2014, the ongoing Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic. Specifically, challenges in capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats have been identified. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using the Third Edition of the guidelines for IDSR as revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018 and adapted to our context in 2020. It is worth noting that, many Public Health Events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate.  To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to  implement these IDSR technical guidelines.  These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Therefore, it is important that we scale up and fully implement this third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in the country as they explicitly describe what needs to be established at each level of the health system in order to detect, confirm and respond to diseases, conditions and health events that are responsible for  illness, deaths and disability in local communities. The cost of good public health surveillance as a public health good is relatively very low compared to many other strategies. Let us all embrace these IDSR technical guidelines to strengthen capacities for preparedness, alert and response for health security in the country. These guidelines are to be used by all relevant multisectoral stakeholders at all levels as general reference for surveillance activities, set of standard definitions for threshold levels that initiate action for responding to specific diseases, stand-alone reference for level-specific responsibilities, resource for developing training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of surveillance activities, and as a guide for improving early detection and response of epidemic prone diseases. Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.

This section describes how to detect priority diseases, conditions, and events using standard case definitions. The section also gives guidance on establishing EBS and using this approach for alerts detection, triaging, and verification to detect public health events. The section also describes procedures that need to be followed when planning for improvements of surveillance and response activities in your catchment area and emphasizes the role of the laboratory in surveillance and response. 1.1 Detection of priority diseases, conditions and events Health staff (human, animal, and environmental) conducts surveillance activities at all levels of the health system (public and private), so they can detect public health problems of concern in their communities.  Community members also play an essential role in surveillance by facilitating early detection and action to priority diseases, conditions, and events. Community members should be oriented about the concept, notion and importance of surveillance to actively detect, report, respond to, and monitor health events related to humans or animals in their catchment area.  Various public health events and/or risks may also present at Points of Entry (PoE); and these health events can be recognized before, during, or after travel, often when travellers have already left the Point of Entry. Staff at Points of Entry must be vigilant in ensuring that these events are identified and reported on time to facilitate response. Surveillance priorities may be communicable and non-communicable diseases, conditions, or events that include national or local priorities such as acute outbreaks and deaths or events associated with human and/or animal health events which might have direct consequences to human health. An essential function of a public health surveillance system is to be vigilant in its capacity to detect not only known public health threats with established case definitions and formal reporting channels but also events or hazards that are not explicitly included in the formal reporting system. These may be events such as clusters of disease patterns or rumours of unexplained deaths. These diseases, conditions, and events may come to the attention of the health system in several ways. For example: A person falls ill and seeks treatment from a health facility. High rate of hospital admission for the same diseases or symptoms  Community members report unusual events or occurrences at local levels such as a cluster of deaths or unusual disease patterns to the health facility, or perhaps a school might report noteworthy absences due to similar signs and symptoms such as an influenza-like illness (ILI).  Health staffs who conduct periodic record reviews to find cases for a specific disease observe that cases of another priority disease have not been reported. For example, an officer who normally reviews the clinic register for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) cases also sees that a case of cholera has also recently been recorded in the clinic register. Health staffs conduct routine record reviews of the laboratory register and observe recorded confirmed cases of priority diseases such as yellow fever or cholera. Radio, television, newspapers, or social media (WhatsApp, Facebook, etc.) report a rumour of rare or unexplained events in the area with potential exposure for humans. Vital events records show an increase in maternal deaths. Unusual reports of illness among health care workers  During analysis of the routine reports from all the facilities in the area, the IDSR focal person notices that other health facilities in the catchment area have also reported adult deaths due to bloody diarrhoea, which might signify there might be an outbreak of Bacillary dysenteriae or Escherichia coli An unusual death or number of deaths among animals, such as livestock, birds or rodent species, or an unusually high number of sick animals presenting with the same signs,  During an assessment of water bodies, Environmental Health Officers observed contamination due to oil spills, chemicals like lead, or other related chemicals from mining activities or different sources, which might be an early trigger for public health interventions. 1.2 Indicator-based Surveillance (IBS) and Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) approaches used to detect priority diseases, conditions and events The IDSR strategy uses both Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) and Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) approaches to detect priority diseases, conditions, and events. Indicator-Based surveillance (IBS) involves reports of specific diseases from health care providers to public health officials. Such information may be described as structured information because the information obtained is standardized. Event-based surveillance (EBS) is defined as the organized collection, monitoring, assessment and interpretation of mainly unstructured ad hoc information regarding health events or risks, which may represent an acute risk to health. As part of efforts to increase the sensitivity of the surveillance system, it is recommended by the World Health Orgnization that all countries should also establish EBS system alongside with the IBS at all levels of the health system i.e. at national, district, health facility and community levels. The IBS involves the use of standard case definitions to identify priority diseases, conditions, and events, whilst EBS uses alert detection, triaging and verification to detect events. In contrast to case definitions that are narrow and disease-specific, EBS requires the detection and immediate reporting of alerts, which are broad and indicate the possibility of a serious public health event. Alerts that are verified are classified as events. It is important to maintain a rumour book where recording of all alerts is done at all levels of the health system. IBS and EBS are integral components of the routine IDSR activities of the surveillance staff. Both IBS and EBS should use existing resources and infrastructure set aside for routine IDSR strategy. 1.3 Use standard case definitions   A standard case definition is an agreed-upon set of criteria used to decide if a person has a particular suspected disease or condition. The definition specifies clinical criteria, laboratory diagnosis and specifications on time, place and person.  Why do we need case definitions? To help decide if a person has a presumed disease or condition or event, or to exclude other potential disease diagnoses. To ensure that every case is diagnosed in the same way, regardless of where or when it occurred, or who identified it.  To initiate action for reporting and investigation quickly if the clinical diagnosis takes longer to confirm. To compare the number of cases of the diseases, conditions or events that occurred in one time or place with the number occurring in another time or place.  Using standard case definitions is also important in implementing the IHR (2005). At all levels, including community, health staff (human, animal, environment) must be aware of case definitions of diseases, condition or events that may afflict not only the local community but also have the potential for spread across geographic boundaries. In describing Standard Case Definitions, for health facility level, a three-tiered classification system is normally used – Suspected, Probable, Confirmed: Suspected case: indicative clinical picture i.e., patient will have fewer or atypical clinical features without being a confirmed or a probable case or is linked epidemiologically to a probable or confirmed case. Probable case: clear clinical picture (meets the clinical case definition) i.e., patient will have typical clinical features of the illness or linked epidemiologically to a confirmed case but a laboratory sample cannot be taken because the case is lost or dead or a sample has been taken but not available for laboratory testing or was not viable for sufficient laboratory testing or test results is inconclusive or staff are not able to take a sample for some reasons. Confirmed case: a suspected or probable case verified by laboratory analysis The classification might vary according to the epidemiology of the individual diseases.  In all outbreak scenarios, a more sensitive case definition to identify all suspected cases should always be used. Identification of cases in these scenarios will use the Syndromic surveillance approach where case detection will be based on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis (See Introduction chapter for the description of Syndromic surveillance). If in the middle of an outbreak, the cause of the agent has been established, cases may continue to be classified as either suspected cases or confirmed cases. An additional tier classification i.e.  “Probable case definition” may be added if officials feel that conducting laboratory tests on every patient with a consistent clinical picture and a history of exposure (e.g., measles) is unnecessary. Case definitions at the community level are usually simplified and are used to facilitate rapid detection of priority diseases, events and conditions or other hazards in the community. Case definitions at this level use key signs and symptoms to help the community to recognize when they should refer a person with these signs and symptoms for treatment and notify the health facility. Examples of how key signs and symptoms of community case definitions may be described are in Annex 1B of this section. All cases (suspected, probable and confirmed) should always be recorded in a recognized facility register or logbook, and the IDSR reporting forms. 1.3.1 One Health approach in identification of events One Health aims at applying a holistic approach in jointly detecting events and conducting risk assessment in responding to possible public health events occurring at the human-animal-environment interface. Detection of events under the One Health approach thus require all levels from community, district, region and national to strengthen collaboration across sectors, and jointly share responsibility of detecting events which might have impact to the health of humans, and their shared environment. Examples of the One Health approach include detection of a rabid animal or reports of animal illness from veterinary sector, which can facilitate investigations of human cases of disease or reports of human diseases which can be traced through exposure to chemical hazards within the environment. Detection of events at PoE also require a One Health approach and this requires involvement of all relevant sectors such as Ministries responsible for health, agriculture, livestock, environment, immigration, and defence.  All events detected should be shared with relevant sectors as part of the One Health approach. 1.3.2 Distribute standard case definitions and registers to health facilities  Make sure that health facility personnel at all levels including PoE(s) know and have available standard case definitions (including those for reporting unusual events, disease patterns, or unexplained deaths) specified by the national level. Malawi is using posters, small-sized booklet and IDSR technical guidelines to disseminate case definitions for diseases under surveillance. These tools reinforce the use of standard case definitions for detecting and reporting priority diseases, conditions and events. Ensure that health facility personnel know the process for recording and reporting including reporting sites. Also ensure the health facilities record rumours. The registers, which are normally used in Malawi, are the Out-Patient Department (OPD) or In-Patient Department (IPD) registers. IDSR Focal Person should always liaise with the Assistant Statistician to extract the priority diseases, conditions or public health events of IDSR from the register.   Proposed case definitions based on established disease-specific programs are in Annex 1A and are also available in Section 11 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines. 1.3.3 Distribute community level case definitions using key signs and symptoms  Provide information to community health workers, traditional healers, birth attendants, community leaders, religious leaders and community volunteers on how to recognize and report priority diseases, conditions or events to the health facility staff. The case definitions for community level should be simpler than those used in health facilities. A list of example of case definitions for use at the community level is in Annex 1B of this section. At the same time, emphasize on the need to refer people with the suspected disease or condition for treatment. Provide them with procedures for reporting including when and where to report; and ensure provision of necessary tools. Design community alert forms and tools (see Annex 2C) for reporting events to enable them to refer a suspected case. Show them how to fill information and those who are non-literate, develop mechanisms of capturing information of events from them. Think of mechanisms like identifying someone from the family member who can assist with actual writing. In addition, provide information to the community on priority diseases, using posters, newsletters and announcements during meetings. Also provide feedback methods and how timely information to the community will be done, as it will encourage community members to participate in surveillance and response activities and also to understand the people in their community and changes in their health.  1.4 Establish Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) at all levels Ensure that event-based surveillance (EBS) system is established at all levels of the health system alongside with the Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS).  The establishment of EBS involves taking into consideration the functions of EBS as illustrated in figure 1. Figure 1: Functions of EBS at all levels of the health system The following steps are followed in establishing and monitoring an EBS system: Step 1: Establish EBS Hotlines and Media Scanning or use already existing community structures for Alert Detection  Step 2: Alerts/Rumours Detection Step 3: Registration of EBS Alerts Step 4: Conduct triaging of EBS Alerts Step 6: Conduct risk assessment and characterization Step 5: Conduct Verification of EBS alerts The steps for establishing EBS at national, district, health facility and community levels are described in Annex 1C of this section. 1.5 Update district procedures for surveillance and response Each year national and district health officials should work together to update and adjust procedures for surveillance and response accordingly.  1.5.1 Update the description of the catchment area At least annually, update information about the catchment area (health facilities, PoE, laboratories). This activity should be part of the health planning at district, as well as national level. Make sure there is a description on local population characteristics in the catchment area, what activities are happening, what risks should be accounted for, and what surveillance assets and gaps exist.  Risk mapping should extend to all public health hazards as specified by IHR (2005), including chemical, zoonotic, radiological and nuclear. It is important to also include results from the risk mapping. WHO has developed an integrated risk profiling tool for assessment of public health threats, and this can be used within the broader framework of disaster risk management. (Strategic Tool for Assessing Risk Star, WHO, Draft Version, 3.3.1, July 2017) Examples of potential risks include sources of contaminated water, lack of urgent transportation to a referral facility for women in childbirth, or potential hazards such as inadequate safety precautions in mining or occupational sites or slums where there is public health risk especially during heavy rains or poor latrine coverage. To update the catchment area description, make sure you have current information about: The size of key target populations at all levels such as children less than 5 years of age, school-aged children, women of childbearing age, all children and adults from ages 1 to 30, people living in refugee settlements, internally displaced persons’ settlement, out of school youth, and other vulnerable groups. Major public health activities in the area including public, private, and non-governmental organization (NGO), immunization activities, clean water projects, family planning clinics, feeding centres for malnourished children, refugee camp health activities, information related to risk factors for non-communicable diseases and so on.  In updating the district profile, you can use several methods among them is the creation of a forum with key health stakeholders at all levels, whereby there will be discussion on surveillance and response activities related to priority health events at the district level and this can facilitate getting updates from stakeholders on various key areas in surveillance and response in which they are involved. This could be done through a monthly or quarterly meeting. Also, take the opportunity to provide feedback about surveillance data which is reported from their institutions to the district. Involve officials from other relevant sectors in the forum to address health matters in a One Health approach.  1.5.2 Update the list of reporting sites and the names of focal surveillance officers in the district Identify all of the health facilities, Points of Entry, and any other location in the country including community focal points required to report surveillance data or events to the next level. Create relationships with private facilities and NGOs, including the faith-based sites in the country, and involve them in surveillance activities.  All private laboratory facilities should be reporting to the District Health Office.  Record (update as needed) health facility and Points of Entry (PoE) locations and names of staffs who are responsible for surveillance activities. Update also the records for community focal points which may include community health workers, animal health surveillance assistants, assistant veterinary officers, trained birth attendants, community and religious leaders, public safety officials etc. Ensure that telephone and email contact information is recorded. Ensure that also in recording or updating the focal persons, identification is done of whether the focal persons have been trained in surveillance or not in order to plan for either new training or orientation to update their skills. A sample worksheet for listing the reporting sites and contact focal person at each site is in Annex 1D of this section. 1.5.3 Identify potential Community representatives that can be engaged in community-based surveillance Any community member acceptable by the community can be a community-based surveillance (ComBaS) focal person. They should be selected by the communities they live in so as to increase empowerment and ownership of ComBaS. Representation could be from basic community-level services such as trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers, village leaders (religious, traditional or political), school teachers, veterinarians, human and animal health extension workers, chemical producer and seller, and traditional healers and in many communities, a respected non-health person such as the barber, shop keeper, security personnel who regularly talks to community members are effective focal points.   Keep an updated inventory of the selected people with their contact information, including the corresponding health facility. This inventory shall build on top of the existing National Health Facility Registry system as surveillance information. Ensure they have a list of simplified community case definitions to facilitate case detection and reporting. A sample worksheet for listing the reporting sites and contact focal person at each site is in Annex 1D of this section. 1.5.4 Distribute updated data collection forms, reporting tools, line list, registers and technical guidelines As you conduct updates of the catchment area description, check to see that all reporting sites have an adequate supply of surveillance reporting tools (forms, line list, registers or other means for reporting surveillance data to the district). This must also be done during regular supervisory visits. Include updates about forms and procedures for reporting, investigating and responding to public health events in quarterly district meetings with health facilities and other reporting sites. Ensure you keep and update an inventory of all information to assist you in necessary follow-ups.  1.6 Role of the laboratory in surveillance and response There are several diseases or conditions with signs and symptoms that are the same or similar as other diseases or conditions. For example, a child with fever and rash over the entire body might be diagnosed with measles, even though there could be several causes for the child’s clinical presentation (e.g. scarlet fever, rubella). Laboratories should be used as early warning alerts to detect pathogens and other hazards that have potential to spread e.g. emergence of resistant strains in the hospital or the community (e.g. multi-drug resistant tuberculosis). Laboratory confirmation of diagnoses of diseases, conditions and events under surveillance is essential in order to: Accurately confirm the diagnosis in an individual patient, and Verify the cause (or aetiology) of a suspected outbreak. 1.6.1 Specimen collection, storage and transportation The type of specimen collected and its packaging (storage media) depends on the suspected disease. Specimens should be collected in adequate quantity into appropriate containers at the healthcare facility level or, if necessary, in the field during an outbreak investigation. All specimens must be triple packaged and labelled correctly and accompanied with the correct laboratory forms in order to arrive at the laboratory in good condition, and provide reliable results. Minimize delays between collection of the specimen and processing in the laboratory. Use of sample tracking forms (chain of custody) shall be encouraged in order to enable tracking of the samples form the send to the receiver and back. The tracking and feedback mechanism shall be well developed and implemented within the National Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) through the digital health support. Ensure health facilities have trained personnel, equipment as well as adequate reagents and consumables to enable sample collection. A clearly defined transportation process is required to enable health facilities to understand where to send samples. Many factors can affect the reliability of interpretation of laboratory test results. For example, results are difficult to interpret when: Specimen is collected inappropriately, for example, a blood specimen has haemolysed. Delay in transportation and or processing may result in bacterial contaminant in a collected specimen such as urine. Use of wrong transport or storage media or container may cause reduced viability of the suspected organism. Given antibiotics before specimen for cultures are collected Use of wrong temperature for storage of specimen The disease specific reference tables in Section 11 of these 3rd Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines list recommended laboratory procedures for confirming priority diseases and conditions including: The diagnostic test for confirming the disease or condition The specimen to be collected When to collect the specimen How to collect the specimen How to prepare, store and transport the specimen When to expect the results Sources for additional information. It is necessary to initiate public health measures even before laboratory confirmation has been received. It should be noted that the patient should be contained basing on signs and symptoms and case management should be initiated immediately even prior to laboratory results such as in the case of Viral Haemorrhagic Fevers.  1.6.2 Establish a laboratory network It is crucial to improve collaboration between human and veterinary and other relevant public health laboratories in line with the One Health approach to meet the national surveillance goal. From human surveillance perspective, the local surveillance and the laboratory focal persons at each level of the health system should maintain an updated list of the laboratories that have the capacity to perform required laboratory testing. A sample worksheet for listing national laboratories for confirming priority diseases and conditions is in Annex 1G of this section. Provide information to all health facilities about the methods for transporting specimens including where to send, how to prepare, handle, ship and store the specimens. Make sure to disseminate information about packing and shipping infectious material as directed by national policy. At national reference laboratory, central hospital, district, health facility and community levels the focus is on safe collection, handling, transportation and processing of specimens as well as giving prompt feedback. The local surveillance or laboratory focal person should establish or strengthen routine communication with identified laboratories that receive specimens from your health facility or district. The purpose of this routine contact is to strengthen communication between the health facilities in the district that will be sending specimens, and the laboratory that will be receiving them. Develop procedures so that each entity understands their roles and responsibilities. Ensure that the procedures for specimen collection, transportation, confirming the disease or condition through laboratory testing and reporting the results are clear and can be reliably carried out. To support the central hospital laboratories and district level laboratories within the network, the national level health authority will establish a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with laboratories outside the area or network that have the capacity for specific diagnostic procedures not available locally. The national level should also support the laboratory through advocacy with high decision makers in putting mechanism and structure to procure and access rapidly when needed the necessary supplies to collect, handle, store, and ship specimens safely through the network. 1.6.3 Update inventory of supplies, reagents and equipment used for confirmation of diseases from laboratories performing the test Surveillance activities should actively work with the laboratories regarding supplies, reagents and equipment to avoid duplication and maintain an updated list available in each laboratory. This should be done especially in public health facilities; but an attempt should also be made from private facilities to obtain a comprehensive inventory. The inventory should consist of contact details including telephone numbers of the laboratory focal persons. 1.6.4 Describe laboratory procedures for confirming priority diseases and conditions The national level will ensure that laboratory protocols, guidelines and standard operating procedures (SOPs) are established and known at all levels. A laboratory focal person should be identified at all levels who will ensure that laboratory protocols, guidelines and SOPs are followed at their assigned level. Refer to Annex 1F for roles and responsibilities of laboratory focal persons at all levels.  1.6.5 Establish a laboratory quality control and assurance program A quality assurance program (internal and external quality control) is the backbone of good laboratory performance. Laboratory quality control and quality assurance are important for building confidence in the results obtained. Establishing or strengthening the laboratory quality assurance programmes will allow improvement of the reliability and reproducibility of laboratory results. The district and central level laboratories should coordinate with National Public Health Reference Laboratory authorities to establish activities for ensuring quality results from laboratories in the catchment area.  Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are among the most important documents in a diagnostic laboratory. Ensure each laboratory has up-to-date written SOPs for all techniques performed in the laboratory. These procedures should be the same throughout the lab network in Malawi so that each lab is performing tests in the same manner. These SOPs should also incorporate internal quality controls. In addition, laboratory should participate in quality assurance programs and corrective actions implemented based on sub-standard/poor results, in order to maintain excellence in the laboratory. The National Public Health Reference Laboratory should encourage laboratories to engage in the WHO Stepwise Laboratory Improvement Process Towards Accreditation (SLIPTA) if not yet accredited. Refer to WHO Stepwise Laboratory Quality Improvement Process towards Accreditation (SLIPTA) [Checklist Version 2:2015 for Clinical and Public Health Laboratories for how to do SLIPTA assessment and http://apps.who.int/iris/handle/10665/204423] 1.7 Annexes to Section 1 Annex 1A: \\tStandard case definitions for reporting suspected priority diseases, conditions and events from the health facility to the district Annex 1B: \\tCommunity level case definitions using key signs and symptoms Annex 1C: \\tGuide for establishing Event Based Surveillance (EBS) at National, Regional/Provincial, District and Health Facility levels Annex 1D: \\tList of district reporting sites Annex 1E: \\tLaboratory functions by health system level Annex 1F: \\tResponsibilities of Laboratory Focal Persons at all levels  Annex 1G: \\tList of national health and veterinary laboratories for confirming priority diseases, conditions, and events Annex 1H:\\tDistrict log of suspected outbreaks or public health events and rumours Annex 1A:\\tStandard case definitions for reporting suspected priority diseases conditions and events from the health facility to the district The following are standard case definitions for reporting suspected cases of priority diseases, conditions and events to the district level.

Use key signs and symptoms of case definitions which have simple language and easier to understand than the IDSR health facility case definitions. The following are examples of some of selected case definitions which can be used to help the community to recognize the diseases and refer a person with these signs for treatment and notify the health facility.

Information is initially captured as an alert which is considered by the Early Warning and Response System as an alert representing potential acute risk to human health, such as an outbreak. All alerts may not necessarily become real events, as such they all need to be triaged and verified before a response is initiated.  EBS provides the opportunity for early detection of events leading to timely response. It is therefore mandatory that EBS alongside with IBS is established at all levels of the health system; namely national, district, health facility and community levels. The following are the description of the required steps for establishing EBS at national, district and health facility levels.  NB: EBS at community level has been described in the Introduction Section of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines. Steps for establishing EBS at National Level Step 1:  Establish EBS Hotlines and Media Scanning for Alert Detection This step involves two major activities namely establishing EBS Hotlines and Media Scanning Centres as described below: A.  Establish EBS Hotlines: A hotline is a phone line that the public can use to obtain information from an organization or to give the organization information. It is a short number to receive direct phone calls or information from social media platforms such as WhatsApp, Facebook, or Twitter, and rumours from communities (words from mouth).  It should be toll free to the public – meaning the cost of reporting alerts to public health authorities should be ZERO. It is recommended to have a single number that can be used as a hotline to make reporting easy to remember. The same number can be used for hotline, Short Message Service (SMS), Unstructured Supplementary Service Data (USSD) and social media platforms to avoid confusion. For example, Malawi’s Public Halth Emergency Operation Centre (PHEOC) hotline number is “929”, messages sent by SMS or Facebook, WhatsApp Messenger should also be sent to the same number. Community residents should be motivated to self-report events that may impact the public’s health, including emerging public health events or outbreaks. Disseminate the hotline number by advocacy through health authourities, community health volunteers, non-governmental organizations, religious and other leaders, or schools and also advertise through messaging in local languages by TV, radio, newspapers and digital social media platforms. Develop partnership with communication companies that can spread the hotline number by test messages to their clients. The messages sent should include the purpose of the EBS, the importance of immediately reporting alerts and how alerts can be reported. Train a team of employees to operate the EBS hotline 24 hours to respond to calls or request information from the community. This can and shall be integrated as one of the routine activities of the PHEOC. The Call methodology:  The responder to the call should start by greeting and thanking them for their proactivity to report to the ministry of health or rellevant ministry hosting the hotline, concerning potential public health events. Then the responder should follow a prepared set of questions that directly reflect parametersin the alert logbook. (Annex 1H of this section) The call should be ended by thanking the caller for their time , patience and proactivity. The responder should directly register in the digital alert logbook the alerts that meet the pre-defined list of alerts. Calls should be returned as soon as possible in situations where a call is interupted or disconnected or if calls are received while the responder is busy; this will ensure that all alerts are collected. The Messaging methodology:  Once an SMS or a social media message is received, an instant automated message should greet the sender, thank them and state that an operator will contact them. Automated questions in the digital product so it can collect information from the sender. Data should be registered directly in the digital alert logbook according to the pre-defined list of alerts for Malawi and imported to the Rumour Log of the One Healh Surveillance Platform (OHSP). Information about the sender should be collected for further communication and details about the alerts reported. A direct call to the sender may be needed if more information is required. NB: Hotlines should be established at National and District level. At National level: The hotline with the call respondents shall be established at the National Public Health Emergency Operation Centre (PHEOC) to capture and register alerts from the entire country. At District Level: The hotline can be established at the District Health Office premises to capture and register alerts from the district including the health facilities and community focal persons. The district level hotline shall be able to receive routing calls from the National level PHEOC in the event of urgent needs. B.  Establish Media Scanning Centre Media are channels of general communication amongst a population and they act as gathering tools used to store and disseminate information or data. E.g. newspapers, magazines, TV, radio, bulletins, social media and other printed forms of communication, as well as electronic or online sources. Media scanning is an active process that should be performed using different media. Media scanning is recommended to be performed at national level as one of the routine activities of the PHEOC. Train health personnel or PHEOC operators to conduct media scanning regularly e.g. daily. The sources of media scanning can be official and non-official. Official Media sources:  NB: Alerts detected from official sources are reliable and do not need further verification. Examples of official media sources: Websites of governmental sectors including, Ministries of Health, Agriculture, Environment, Foreign Affairs etc. Websites for official organizations such as universities and international recognized centres of research e.g. CDC, Africa CDC. WHO Official websites for Early Warning e.g. WHO IHR Event Information Site for National Focal Points, which is secured platform accessible only to national focal points. WHO Disease Outbreak News. Websites for WHO regional offices e.g. AFRO, EMRO, EURO, SEARO, WPRO, PAHO. Disease-specific websites e.g. Global Influenza Surveillance and Response. Unofficial Media sources: NB: Alerts detected through these sources are not reliable and need to be verified. Examples of unofficial media sources: Newspapers and magazines Online content of TV and radio channels Social media e.g. WhatsApp, Facebook, Twitter  Unofficial websites e.g. ProMED, The Global Information Network (GPHIN), HealthMap, MEDISYS etc. Methods of online media scanning Online information scanning can be done manually and automatically The Steps for Manual Scanning Develop a checklist for scheduled (e.g. Daily) review of online sources. Develop a list of prioritized alerts regarding strategies, capacities and resources for Malawi. Develop a list for keywords related to the prioritized alerts including diseases, syndromes or events. Visit all predetermined websites in the checklist of online sources to scan for keywords.  The Steps for Automated Scanning There are multiple automated technological tools that can be used for scanning of online information from predefined sources. These tools can save time and effort and support early detection of public health threats. Examples of automated scanning are: Rich site summary i.e. RSS feeds are standardized software tools that monitor the pre-defined websites and inform the user with updates. Contributor-based sources are based on sharing information among health professionals, in which individuals collect information that can be accessed through shared feeds e.g. ProMed.  Automated information feeds or services developed by governments or international organizations that collect health information from several sources and then can decrease time spent in scanning for individual sources. These are called data aggregators. “Google Alert” service: it is a content change detection and notification service, offered by the search engine company Google. The service sends emails to the user when it finds new results—such as web pages, newspaper articles, blogs, or scientific research—that match the user\\'s search term. Surveillance officers can set-up the key words for automated scanning using the Google Alert service. Step 2: Alerts Detection Alerts detection is the process of capturing information on the potential public health events reported to the hotline. Members of the general public may communicate with the hotline desk through phone calls, SMS, USSD, social media messaging or website chats. The hotline desk team should filter received notifications from callers to determine which alerts are valid. A list of alerts developed by national public health authourities should be provided to the hotline desk operators, or responders, so that they are able to continue with the registration of alerts. The call responder and operator should register valid alerts in the alert logbook. Alerts can also be detected by media scanning either manually or automated. Examples of pre-detemined alerts: Code\\ufdd0Alerts to be reported\\ufdd001\\ufdd0Two or more persons presenting with similar severe illness in the same setting (e.g. household, workplace, school, street) within one week\\ufdd002\\ufdd0Unexplained large number of deaths of poultry, livestock, other domestic animals or wildlife\\ufdd003\\ufdd0Severe illness of a healthcare worker after exposure to patients with similar symptoms\\ufdd004\\ufdd0One or more hospitalized patients with unexplained severe illness, including failure to respond to standard treatment Step 3: Registration of EBS Alerts Alerts that are captured from media and hotlines and correspond to the pre-defined list of alerts, should be registered in the alert book. See Sample Alert Logbook for Hotlines and/or Media Scanning on the next page. Each alert captured should include data about the alert’s detection, triage and verification, until the response. Alert registration should include the minimum data set for tracking the alerts for example; Source/informant: Name, contact phone and time and date of the call/detection; Alert: when it happened, who was affected (cases, deaths) and where it starts and spreads. Follow-up of the alert: Triage, verification, risk assessment and response.

If the alert matches with one of the priority alerts for Malawi, the alert should immediately undergo verification. If the alert is generically defined, e.g. an unusual event that may pose a public health threat, a qualified public health specialist or team leader should assess the alert to decide whether to discard the alert, or to proceed for verification. Step 5: Conduct Verification of EBS Alerts Verification is an essential step to confirm the validity of the captured alerts and should be conducted by the rapid response team (RRT). Verification should be done at the local level nearest to the location of the alert. If the alert is detected at national level, this is reported to the respective district IDSR focal person where the alert is located by phone call or Instant Message (e.g. WhatsApp) or SMS or email etc.  A trained district RRT with support from national experts should conduct verification of the alerts. All alerts should be verified within 24hours. Once an alert is verified and requires action, it is determined to be an event. District RRT with support from national experts should promptly start investigations by collecting further information in the field (conducting physical examinations, collecting lab samples etc.) using the existing respective IDSR case/event investigation forms. The confirmed events that meet the standard case definition should be captured by the respective IDSR focal person in the IBS system and reported to the national level i.e. through the existing IDSR data collection tools and follow the IDSR reporting procedures (refer to Section 2 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines). Step 6: Conduct risk assessment and characterization Once an alert is verified as an event, risk assessment begins.  Risk assessment is a systematic and continuous process for gathering, assessing and documenting information to provide the basis for actions to manage and reduce the negative consequences of an acute public health event.  The first risk assessment of an event should take place within 48 hours of the detection of one or more alerts. The National team should lead the risk assessment with the respective district RRT.  Every assessment is a process by which the available information about a real event is analysed and judgement is made as to whether it poses an immediate risk to public health. In this case full risk assessment is done (refer to section 4 of the 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines).  For alerts that has been substantiated as true event but do not pose an immediate threat to public, the team should monitor the event and undertake risk assessments when new information becomes available Steps for establishing EBS at district level The steps for establishing EBS at district level follows similarly as at the national level. However, the District RRT mostly receives EBS-related information in the form of alerts mainly from the health facilities and communities through phone calls/text messages/WhatsApp/verbal.  Receive and document alert reports: Record verbal or written information from health facilities and communities about suspected outbreaks, rumours, unexplained events/alerts into the District Logbook of suspected outbreaks (refer to Section 4, Annex 4A of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines). The district RRT should carry out the following functions: Triaging, Verification and Risk Assessment. Triage alerts When the District RRT receive information about a reported alert, they should conduct triaging by asking the following questions: Is the reported information relevant to early warning (i.e. could this alert be genuine public health event?) Was this alert previously reported (i.e., is this alert a duplicate?) Triage can take place in person-field visit, by text messaging or over the phone. After triage: If the report is not relevant or is a duplicate, then it can be discarded. There is no further action that is needed to be taken. If the information is to be discarded, communicate the following information to the IDSR facility focal persons/Surveillance focal persons who reported the alert: They should continue to monitor the situation and notify the district if the situation changes and alert is met. It is okay that they have reported an alert that has been determined to be false alert, and they are encouraged to continue reporting alerts when they are detected. If the report is pertinent and is not a duplicate, then the information must be verified by the district RRT that received the information about the alert. Verify alerts The district RRT must verify all triaged alerts that are pertinent to EBS. The district RRT receiving alerts from health facilities and communities must also verify these alerts before they are determined to be events. Verification is the determination that an alert is valid (i.e. it is not a false alarm or a false rumour), reliable, and that it corresponds to at least one of the alerts pre-defined for EBS implementation. Criteria for verification may include asking questions of those who have notified the alert to ensure that they have correctly understood the alert, whether or not the alert has been confirmed by at least two different sources, or the fact that the alert has been notified by a person with medical authority (e.g. veterinarian, physician or lab assistant. To conduct verification, the district RRT will ask questions of the person reporting the alert, and possibly other people as well. This can include the patient, the family and friends of the patient and/or other people within the community. Verification can take place in person by field visit or over the phone. Use the EBS verification tool; see sample of Event-Based Surveillance: Verification Tool on next page. The result of verification is the confirmation that the alert is true or false. Once alert is verified it becomes an event.  After verification: If the alert is considered to be a public health event, it is reported to immediately to the national level. If the alert is not considered to be a public health event, the situation will be monitored to ensure it does not become a public health event. Record confirmed events in existing IDSR data collection tools and platforms and report to next level (Refer to Section 2 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines). Conduct Risk Assessment as per the national guidance. Sample of Event-Based Surveillance: Verification Tool When an alert is notified by a ComBaS Focal Person or health facility, District RRT will use this tool to verify whether the alert is TRUE or FALSE  The process of alert verification should answer three main questions: Is the report accurate (i.e. true)? Has the information been reported by a reliable source or sources? Does the report meet the criteria for one or more alerts? Steps for establishing EBS at health facility level The steps involve considering the following important points: Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) in health facilities encompasses immediate, weekly and monthly reporting of pre-determined list of diseases based on case definitions. Event-Based Surveillance (EBS) in health facilities (HEBS) trains clinicians, nurses, and other relevant healthcare professionals to report on pattern of disease alerts, such as a cluster of illnesses and is not disease specific. EBS may allow for detection of emerging or re-emerging public health threats because it is not disease-specific, requires immediate notification, and is highly sensitive and broad. Additionally, since reporting does not require laboratory results for reporting and relies on clinicians’ experience, EBS is more practical and fairly simple to establish and sustain. Health facilities should participate in both IBS and EBS since the two complement each other leading to early detection of diseases, conditions and events. Steps for establishing EBS in health facilities Step 1: Alert detection Select and train IDSR facility focal persons: Existing IDSR facility focal persons can be trained to perform this role. IDSR facility focal persons must inform other staff to immediately notify them when they see or hear about one of the alerts happening in their workplace. Healthcare professionals including clinicians, nurses, and preventive health officers should be sensitized to recognize alerts and report them immediately. Detecting an alert means identifying or suspecting the occurrence of the pre-determined alerts designated by national public health authorities. Examples of HFEBS alerts: Code\\ufdd0Health Facility EBS Alerts to be reported\\ufdd001\\ufdd0Any severe illness in health staff after taking care of a patient with similar illness\\ufdd002\\ufdd0Large, sudden increase in admission for any severe illness of the same type\\ufdd003\\ufdd0Any severe, unusual, unexplainable illness including a failure to respond to standard treatment\\ufdd004\\ufdd0Increase use of a particular medicine Step 2: Reporting Alerts Reporting alerts involves communicating with an IDSR facility focal person/surveillance Focal Persons in the health facilities who intend report to the district RRT immediately. This can be done by telephone call, SMS, or in person, but it must happen immediately: on the same day and as soon as possible. Step 3: Triaging and verification The district RRT upon receipt of report of alerts should triage and verify all alerts within 24 hours of alert detection using the verification tool. In case of true event immediate investigations and response measures is implemented as per the existing IDSR structures. The district RRT should provide regular feedback to the reporting health facilities. Annex 1D: List of district reporting sites Record information for contacting the health workers or community health workers or PoE officers or anyone who provide information to the district related to surveillance and outbreak, events detection. Include, for example, community health workers, trained birth attendants, community leaders and public safety officials.

Ensuring reliable reporting of surveillance data throughout the system is important. Reliable reporting provides information for surveillance officers, district health authorities, epidemiologists, and border health authority at Point of Entry (PoE), program managers, the national IHR focal point, the WHO contact point and other health staff to: Identify emerging problems or conditions and plan appropriate responses, including informing relevant staff or levels Take action in a timely way Monitor disease trends in the area Evaluate the effectiveness of the response This section describes how to report priority diseases, conditions and events within the required timelines. In IDSR, data collection and data reporting follow different timeliness for different purposes: Immediate reporting of case-based information allows for early detection of unexpected or highly pathogenic/lethal public health events. All the diseases and conditions under immediate reporting should also be reported under aggregated weekly report in the Weekly IDSR Summary Reporting Form. Weekly aggregated reporting provides data for monitoring trends of diseases, conditions or events to early detect outbreaks.  Monthly/quarterly aggregated reporting provides data for monitoring the health status of the population and impact of disease specific programs, and for planning allocation of resources.  Below is the chart for report deadline to next reporting level Chart for reporting deadlines to the next level Level\\ufdd0Deadline for reports to reach the next higher level\\ufdd0Immediate\\ufdd0Weekly\\ufdd0Monthly\\ufdd0Quarterly\\ufdd0Community\\ufdd0Within 24 hours\\ufdd0NA\\ufdd0NA\\ufdd0NA\\ufdd0Health Facility\\ufdd0Within 24 hours*\\ufdd0Monday of the following week, before 12:00 pm\\ufdd03rd day of the following month, before 5:00 pm\\ufdd05th day of the month following the end of the quarter\\u2029(5th April, 5th July, 5th October, 5th January)\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0District\\ufdd0Within 24 hours\\ufdd0Tuesday of the following week, before 12:00 pm\\ufdd05th day of the following month, before 5:00 pm\\ufdd07th day of the month following the end of the quarter\\u2029(7th April, 7th July, 7th October, 7th January)\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0National\\ufdd0Within 24 hours\\ufdd0Wednesday of the following week, before 12:00 pm\\ufdd07th day of the following month, before 5:00 pm\\ufdd010th day of the month following the end of the quarter\\u2029(10th April, 10th July, 10th October, 10th January)\\u2029\\u2029 From community level health worker to health centre and facilities, paper-based tools are the most commonly used tools for reporting these diseases, events and conditions. The Ministry of Health is, however, working on a digital Integrated Community Health Information system (iCHIS) to support this reporting need. Whereas, from all health facilities to report to district and national level, an IDSR focal person reports data electronically through the One Health Surveillance platform (OHSP) with DHIS-2 technology. Electronic tools facilitate rapid transmission of data to enable timely response to public health threats is defined as eIDSR. The potential benefits of using electronic reporting tools for eIDSR include: more timely reporting, investigation, and response to outbreaks. Electronic reporting may also improve data quality; enhance virtual, near real-time disease and events monitoring capability; may lead to reduced system costs and easily generate automated alerts. The OHSP is one of the eIDSR tool to facilitate the needs. In addition, information can be more easily stored, accessed and analysed. See Section 9 for electronic IDSR (eIDSR) Guide for Malawi. The targeted public health workforce for IDSR are primarily staff at all levels of the health system (both human, animal and environment), data management and digital health personnel who will oversee the Information Communication Technology (ICT) aspect of the system at all levels, supervisory and disease specific program personnel at all levels i.e. local, district and decision makers at national levels. Malawi will embrace an interoperable and “One Health” approach of strengthening eIDSR by creating systematic linkages and information sharing platforms. This will be done by formalizing agreements between Ministry of Health, Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Nature Resources. Internally, the eIDSR will include all relevant health programmes, departments, sections and units within the MoH, i.e. HMIS, IDSR, Maternal (MDSR), community health service section (iCHIS) and Newborn (PDSR), health services delivery information system (EMRS), national public health reference laboratories and laboratory networks (LIMS). The relevance stakeholders in the Ministry of Agriculture include animal health department, livestock / wildlife units with surveillance function, and veterinary facilities/institutions. Lastly the Ministry Nature Resources for the environment surveillance affairs (e.g. air, water, wastes, soil, etc.).  2.1 Immediate reportable diseases, conditions and events Immediate reporting is indicated when an epidemic-prone disease or other potential Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is suspected or is otherwise required under the International Health Regulations (2005). Immediate reporting should also be done for diseases and events considered priorities at the national level which may not necessarily be PHEICs. The diseases, conditions and events requiring immediate notification to the next level are listed in Table 2.1 Immediate reporting allows timely action to be taken to prevent the re-emergence or rapid transmission of epidemic prone diseases or events or their propagation, especially those due to highly virulent infectious, chemical, biological or radio nuclear agents. Information that is reported immediately, such as single cases or clusters of reportable events, will generate an alert and initiate a case-based surveillance reporting system. This means that, specific information about that suspected case or if it is a cluster, specific information of each of cases identified, will be collected thoroughly and reported to the next level. At the same time, an initial investigation will be initiated. For events reported at PoE, information is reported to the next level (district where the PoE is situated) as well as simultaneously to the IHR NFP. Reporting units with no diagnostic capacity will use the suspected case definition given to identify and report diseases, conditions and events. Additionally, information of contacts will be collected. Section 4 describes to how to conduct contact tracing and also how to report contacts. For conditions like maternal and perinatal deaths, the circumstances leading to the death need to be gathered and analysed and health providers should use the national Maternal Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response (MPDSR) in consultation with the relevant focal points. In IDSR, there are two types of thresholds used to initiate response: an alert threshold and an epidemic threshold. These thresholds are normally expressed in terms of the number (or proportion) of cases of a disease and the critical point (threshold) beyond which action must be taken. Trained health care personnel should always determine the alert and epidemic thresholds. Statistical tools and methods may be applied to determine the alert and epidemic thresholds. Thresholds for alerts and epidemic for epidemic prone diseases, conditions or events are shown in Section 11 of these  3rd Edition of the Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines.  Please refer to Section 11 of the 3rd Edition of these Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines for disease-specific information including surveillance case definitions, alert and epidemic thresholds for reporting suspected cases or events.

Unexpected large numbers of sales at pharmacies of many people buying medicines for the same kind of illness NB: Ensure that adequate information is collected for events which are reported. Some of the events might have a link with the Agricultural or Livestock/Wildlife sector or Food or Environment or other sectors, ensure information is also sought from these sectors. 2.1.1 Report case-based information to the next level If an immediately reportable disease, condition or other public health event is suspected, the health facility must report case-based information to the next level within 24 hours (Annex 2F form). Information obtained through preliminary investigation of suspected case includes; Patient’s geographical location Health facility or facilities that managed or handled the patient or referred the patient Patient’s identification and demographic information Information about signs and symptoms including date of onset, history of vaccination (where applicable) and information about any relevant risk factors including contacts Laboratory results (if available) History of travel  History of contacts (Human or Animal) Time stamp of important potential risk factors (hour, date, etc.) Any maternal or perinatal death, once occurred, it should also be reported immediately within 24 hours of occurrence. A sample reporting form for both is given in Annex 2K. Reference should be made to the national integrated Maternal Perinatal Death Surveillance and Response guidelines. Make the initial report by the fastest means possible (telephone, e-mail, radiophone, text message and social media). The health facility should contact the district health authority immediately and provide information about the patient or event. Follow up the initial verbal report with a written report using a standardized case-based report form. A sample case-based surveillance reporting form for recording case-based information is in Annex 2F at the end of this section. If a computer or other electronic device is available for surveillance or case management, complete and submit the form electronically to the next level. On electronic platforms, ensure you protect the patient privacy by encrypting patient ID data so only few health staff can access the detailed information, or you can also set up appropriate user rights such as creating a password for your use when using a common office computer. In the context of Malawi, this means the reporting can and shall be done electronically using either OHSP or EMRS. If a laboratory specimen is requested at this time, make sure that the patient’s identifying information on the specimen, the lab investigation form, and the case-based surveillance reporting form all match. Ensure proper packaging to ensure reliable results. Ensure also that a copy of the case-based form accompanies the laboratory form and the specimen. A sample laboratory form is included in Annex 2G. Disease-specific case-based reporting forms for particular diseases and conditions of concern (for example: AFP, cholera, VHF, maternal death, and MDR/XDR TB) are in the annex at the end of Section 11 of these 3rd Malawi IDSR TG. These forms may be used to begin gathering initial information for the case investigation. Note: Some epidemic-prone diseases or conditions like Maternal or Perinatal deaths, have specific reporting requirements depending on national policies. Please refer to disease-specific and conditions requirements in Section 11 of these 3rd Malawi IDSR TGs. Ensure that adequate information is available for events which are reported, as some events might have a link with the Agricultural or Livestock, Wildlife sector or Food or environment or other sectors including the community.  Such information sharing is crucial and should start at the community level, health facility and subsequently at the district. At the National level, the IDSR Focal Person/IHR National Focal Point (NFP) should notify WHO of an event that is a potential public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC) using decision instrument in the IHR 2005 (Annex 2A). For all events, establish a line listing of suspected cases or events or conditions reported as part of initial and ongoing investigation and ensure it is always updated, while at the same time maintaining the link with appropriate sectors, depending on a particular disease or event. The line list should be kept where there is a suspected outbreak and where an isolation unit has been opened, but if several isolation units have been opened, the district should maintain a combined line list. Refer to Annex 4E for a sample line list.   For all confirmed cases of immediate reportable diseases, the facility PHERRT and/or district PHERRT shall initiate and conduct an epidemiological field investigation to minimize further transmission, reduce negative impacts and inform responses. Refer to Annex 2M for the field epidemiological investigation tool. 2.1.2 Notifying a potential Public Health Emergency of International concern under IHR 2005 If a potential Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is suspected (as defined in Annex 2A of the IHR 2005), the District IDSR Focal Person should report to the National IDSR Focal Person/IHR Focal Point immediately using the fastest means of communication. If a potential Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) is detected at Point of Entry, immediate reporting should also be made to the National IHR Focal Point, while at the same time notifying the district. (See Annex 2B for a framework of reporting). The process of notifying WHO of events under the IHR involves the use of the “Decision instrument in the IHR.  This is a national level function coordinated by the IHR NFP with the support of appropriate experts, depending on the emergency. 2.1.3 Reporting events from community sources  Any suspected event occurring in the community including cases of maternal and neonatal deaths should be reported immediately. The trigger mechanisms of reporting must be clearly defined and the information must be immediately notified to a community focal person, if already identified, or to a nearby health facility. Minimum information collected should include: Date of event and date of report Suspected disease, condition, or event What happened? When did this happen? (day, month, year) Where did this happen? (Exact location, Village, District,) Who is affected? (Age, gender, occupation etc.) How many have been affected? Has anyone died? If yes, how many? Is the event ongoing? Are there any animal deaths/exposures?  Recent history of travel to an affected area  Other information you have. Name and contact number of the person reporting Any action taken See Annex 2C for a community alert reporting format when an event is identified (electronic version of the Community Reporting function shall be available in the iCHIS), Annex 2D for monthly log sheet summary and Annex 2E reporting structure for community alert and verification of events from community sources. 2.2 Summarize immediate and weekly reportable diseases After an initial case has been detected or an outbreak is suspected or confirmed, summary data are important for analysis and monitoring. For example, at the health facility or district, the surveillance focal point can draw an epidemic curve to see if and when the epidemic thresholds for specific diseases have been crossed. Additionally, these data from epidemic investigation (using Annex 2M tool) can be used to check whether the case fatality rate is below, at or above the expected target; the potential risk factors, etc. The weekly data analysis of the suspected or confirmed epidemic should also help point out possible high-risk groups with regard to a patients’ case location or residence, age group, sex, and exposure during social events (for example, a funeral), occupational hazards (for example, butchering), consuming game meat, or exposure to a contaminated food or beverage. The epidemiological analysis functions (charts and tables) shall be available in the OHSP. At the district level, weekly data analysis includes verification of the quality of the data coming from the reporting sites and the completeness and timeliness of these reports. For eIDSR, an IDSR focal person should be responsible to ensure that data verification is done and approved for further transmission into OHSP/eIDSR. Additionally, an in-depth analysis of individual immediate case-based surveillance reporting forms received from the reporting sites will also be performed, in addition to the weekly aggregated data. The incidence and case fatality rates should be calculated and compared with the set alert and epidemic thresholds to determine if it is increasing or decreasing. Epidemic curves should be updated regularly to monitor the trends or evolution of epidemics occurring in the districts. Districts are required to store the information electronically and forward the surveillance data sets to the next higher level of health system in the digital format. Weekly reporting of immediate notifiable diseases: Weekly reporting provides data for monitoring trends of diseases or conditions to early detect outbreaks. It is important to ensure that the national weekly reporting format is adhered across all health facilities and districts to facilitate comparison within and between the facilities and districts.  After immediately reporting to the next level about instances of notifiable diseases, conditions or events, collect and report weekly summary information of the event or disease or condition of which you have reported as well as for other weekly reported priority diseases, conditions and events, as listed in Table 2.1 See Annex 2H for format for developing a weekly summary form which is an aggregate of case-based forms.  With eIDSR (See Section 9), where EMR or similar digital system is available, this will be updated automatically in the database, while for facilities using paper-based reporting forms; this will be done manually and entered into the OHSP. This aggregation is important to understand the trend of the immediate reportable diseases and plan for effective intervention. For early detection of outbreaks via weekly aggregated reporting, it is recommended to keep the number of variables at a minimum, ideally reporting only number of cases and deaths, to avoid unnecessary burden on the healthcare facilities and maximize reporting efficiency. Based on epidemiological evidence, Malawi may decide to include additional diseases, conditions and events in diseases for weekly reporting e.g. malaria, MDR-TB, Diarrhoea with severe dehydration in children under 5 years of age, severe malnutrition, and neonatal deaths.  Only diseases or conditions or events which could result in public health action should be considered to enter the list of aggregated weekly reporting. Some rare but high-risk public health events may be removed from routine aggregated reporting to be reported on an immediate basis. The list of priority public health events to be reported by healthcare facilities is provided in tables 2.1 and 2.2.  Zero reporting  If no cases of an immediately reportable disease have been diagnosed during the week, record a zero (0) on the reporting form for that disease. If the space is left blank, the staffs that receive the report will not be able to develop information from a blank space. Submitting a zero report for each immediately reportable disease when no cases were detected during the week tells the staff at the next level that a complete report has been filled. 2.3 Report monthly and quarterly routine summary information for other diseases of public health importance At a minimum, report summary data about other endemic diseases to the next level each month. This information is valuable to disease specific programs and can be used when monitoring progress with prevention and control activities as well as for detecting any emergent, unexplained or unusual events or disease patterns. Routinely report the total number of cases and deaths seen in a given period (for example, monthly or quarterly) for other diseases of public health importance. All Health facilities including referral or teaching hospitals should report summary totals to the district under their catchment area. Districts should aggregate reports from all reporting sites and provide summary totals to the central level. Each level should observe any unusual increases or events seen during analysis of monthly summary reports. The summary results should be analysed and the results used to monitor progress toward disease control targets, measure achievements of disease prevention activities in the district and identify hidden outbreaks or problems so that a response action can be taken. Table 2.2: Diseases and conditions Requiring Monthly or Quarterly Reporting Acute/Chronic Viral Hepatitis\\u2029Diabetes mellitus (New cases) (quarterly)\\u2029Diarrhoea with severe dehydration in children under 5 years of age\\u2029Epilepsy (quarterly)\\u2029HIV/AIDS (New Cases)\\u2029Hypertension (New cases) (quarterly)\\u2029Injuries (Road Traffic Accidents)\\u2029Leprosy (quarterly)\\u2029Lymphatic Filariasis\\u2029Malaria\\u2029Malnutrition in children under 5 years\\u2029Onchocerciasis\\ufdd0Severe pneumonia in children under 5 years of age\\u2029Sexually transmitted diseases (STIs)\\u2029Trachoma\\u2029Trypanosomiasis \\u2029Tuberculosis (quarterly)\\u2029Underweight Newborns (less than 2500 g)\\u2029Food borne illness\\u2029Mental health (quarterly)\\u2029Perinatal death\\u2029Neonatal death\\u2029Schistosomiasis\\u2029Soil Transmitted helminths (quarterly) Note: Based on risk mapping and diseases burden, decision can be made to categorize any other diseases conditions or events into immediate, weekly or monthly or quarterly report. Each month, the health facility should calculate the total number of cases (Suspected and Laboratory Confirmed) and deaths due to priority diseases, conditions and events seen in the health facility. Separate totals are calculated for outpatient cases and inpatient cases. The summary totals are recorded on the Weekly and Monthly IDSR report form (please see Annex 2H) and sent to the district level. The district aggregates the totals from all the health facilities that reported and submit district summary totals to the central level.  Special effort should be made to obtain from the health information system, e.g. the electronic medical records system (EMRS), the total number of out-patients and in-patients seen for any health condition (including those not in the IDSR list) during the reported period. On a regular basis (weekly or monthly), review the overall IDSR information system and Health Management Information System (HMIS) to ensure data has been well captured. At least once every month, data validation needs to occur and conduct periodic edits before transmission to next higher level. Patient records should be analysed to generate the weekly, monthly or quarterly reports at all levels. This information is important for producing national reports. All datasets should be shared with the health authorities with a copy to the respective disease prevention and control programme: this is important for coordination at central level, and for the strengthening of a national IDSR information system - OHSP based on DHIS-2. Depending on each level of laboratory services, laboratory data should be organized in a register so that it can generate monthly summaries. During outbreak, submission of the weekly summaries of the specimens processed, the types of specimens and the results should be done to assist in completion of the variables in the line list register. Efforts should be made to also update the laboratory component of the IDSR data and link epidemiologic/clinical data. Monthly summaries can include the core tests done for which the country has selected as indicator pathogens on the basis of major PHEIC. This is important, as the analysis can produce important trends which can necessitate further investigations.  2.4 Improve routine reporting practices In some health facilities, more than one person may be responsible for recording information about patients seen in the facility. For example, the clinician records the patient’s name and diagnosis in a clinic register. Later in the day, a nurse tallies the number of cases and deaths seen in an out-patient service. The ward nurse tallies the number of admitted cases.  Each week, month, or quarter, a records clerk or statistician or IDSR focal person calculates summaries for all the diseases and records them in a standard form. Events should be aggregated separately from diseases. In case the health facility is equipped with computers, individual patient records should be entered, from which the IDSR priority diseases or conditions subset will be extracted and analysed to get the required weekly, monthly or quarterly compilations. In outbreak scenarios, isolation units that are separate from health facilities can be opened, and they will use a different register to record diseases or events. It is important that this information be captured in the overall IDSR weekly, monthly or quarterly summaries. 2.4.1 Review the flow of information at the reporting site  During supervisory visits to reporting sites, ensure that: All reporting sites including secondary and tertiary hospitals in the catchment area of your district are visited Clinicians record legibly information in the patient registers using the recommended case definitions so that health workers who tally the cases at the end of the day can reliably record the required diagnoses on the tally sheet. Clinicians, ward nurses or other responsible staff should complete the case-based surveillance (CBS) reporting form preferably while the patient is still present. Clinicians record laboratory results in the patient registers In health facilities with laboratories, laboratories should record results of IDSR priority diseases in the laboratory registers with linkage to epidemiologic data Integration of laboratory results into the IDSR reporting forms should be conducted at the health facility level Record clerks or statisticians or IDSR focal persons have summary forms that contain spaces for recording cases and deaths due to the priority diseases or conditions according to the standard case definitions. Health staff reviews the weekly, monthly and quarterly IDSR data summary totals and provide comments on the forms about results seen during data analysis. (See Section 3). Health workers record the summary totals on a recommended weekly, monthly and quarterly IDSR summary reporting form (See Annex 2H). 2.4.2 Keeping records and procedures for managing reporting forms Keep a record of IDSR forms, notifications and reports received at your level. The record you keep is an essential data source for calculating indicators for national IHR report and for monitoring performance of the IDSR indicators. A sample IDSR Reports and Data Sharing Log Book form is in Annex 2I. Periodically check with reporting sites that you supervise (community, health facility and district) to ensure that the correct forms and procedures are available to staff so they can record and report the required cases of priority diseases and conditions: Take steps to ensure that all health workers know or have access to the standard case definitions recommended by national policy. Establish or modify existing procedures so that all health workers are able to apply the standard case definitions in detecting and reporting priority diseases, conditions, outbreaks or events. Sensitize staffs on diseases or conditions that require immediate reporting for case-based surveillance including potential PHEIC and other priority diseases or events of national concern. For example, all the health staff should be aware of epidemic-prone diseases for which a single suspected or probable case is a suspected outbreak requiring immediate action, and of any unusual or unexplained event with potential for affecting human health. Review with health staff the role that case-based data plays in determining risk factors and the means of disease transmission or exposure to health risks in a public health event. Make sure the staffs have access to a standardized form for reporting case-based information. Ensure that the surveillance unit has access to fast communication means (facsimile, internet connection, telephone, text message, electronic mail, telegrams, personal messages, or other rapid communication means). For the district, specify how the district should notify the national level and who should be contacted at district, facility and community level. 2.4.3 Perform periodic checks on data quality While each provider may have some preferred methods for filling in forms, describing diseases, or abbreviating terms, it is important for every level of reporting (Facility, district, national) to use a standard approach to recording and reporting, as data that are not comparable, will lead to inappropriate decisions. Some of the examples of factors which may affect data quality that needs to be periodically checked include; Poorly completed forms (missing values, etc.),  Incomplete forms (e.g. presence of blanks),  Under-reporting or Over-reporting of cases,  Duplicate reporting,  Unsystematic data collection and reporting Untruthful reporting, (e.g. reporting zero, while there is an ongoing outbreak of epidemic prone diseases)  Inconsistent reporting formats (forms),  Late submission or reporting, Inconsistent reporting periods,  Calculation errors on aggregate reports,  Lack of documentation, and source data or files are lost.  During supervision, stress the importance of data quality and surveillance; that correct data will lead to analysis, interpretation, and the information that will be communicated will lead to action and evaluation. It is recommended that regular data quality audits are conducted at the reporting sites.  (See Annex 2J for checklist on key elements to assess in data quality audits) 2.4.4 Enhance linkages to strengthen community-based surveillance (ComBaS) A community-based surveillance (ComBaS) system relies on the community member’s capacity to identify and report public health problems to the nearest health facility or to the district health office. In this system, ComBaS focal persons identify and report events in the community that have public health significance. ComBaS focal persons act as community informants, and they report to the health facility, or in the case of a serious event, directly to the district authorities. The community health care workers may conduct the ComBaS using the integrated community health information system (iCHIS) as the reporting tool. Community representatives that can be members of ComBaS team  Any community member acceptable by the community can be a ComBaS focal person. Representation could be from basic village-level services such as trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers, community health workers or volunteers, village leaders (religious, traditional or political) or school teachers, veterinarians, health extension workers, chemical sellers, and traditional healers. Once selected, the ComBaS focal persons should receive training and carry out supportive supervision on how to recognize certain diseases or health conditions for the purpose of reporting suspect cases.  Example: The community volunteer/village health member hears of several cases of acute watery diarrhoea with vomiting in the community. The informant suspects cholera and reports the alert to the local health facility and to the district level heath officer by text messaging, iCHIS notification, WhatsApp message or phone call. Members of the RRT travel to the community to verify and investigate the possible outbreak, and, based on the investigation results, implement control and prevention measures. The outbreak is quickly contained. Thanks to the early warning from the community-based surveillance liaison. District staff may identify sources in the community with opportunity to know about the community’s health status. Examples of community sources include: Chemical Sellers School teachers Staff at private clinics Village leaders Religious leaders Traditional healers Birth attendants Community health workers  Community animal health workers  Community Based Organizations (CBOs)  Other societal leaders  Veterinary health workers Any individuals involved in neighbourhood watch or other active surveillance approaches  Other community resource persons Choice of source of information will depend on the event, resource availability and the context. The District Health Offices should organize community-based surveillance focal points by: Working with community leaders to identify members of the community (key informants) to receive relevant training. Train and provide job aids (e.g. Community Registers, leaflets of cases definitions etc.) on priority diseases and public health events or hazards to community health informants. Give enough information about the disease so that the community source can refer cases to the health facility, or notify the health facility when unusual or unexplained health events occur in the community  Involve community volunteers/village health committee members in risk mapping, emergency simulation exercises and risk communication during outbreaks Ensure that the ComBaS gives regular and timely feedback of diseases/events reported from the community level. Districts need to ensure that there is sustained commitment by ComBaS and hence to continuously engage them.  Disseminate alert and epidemic thresholds Please refer to the list in Annex 1B of key signs and symptoms to use in case definitions for community surveillance. 2.4.5 Strengthen linkages between Laboratory and Surveillance information Public health laboratory system complements the syndromic disease surveillance.  In case of a public health event, the laboratory where confirmation took place is to report the laboratory results as soon as the confirmation has been done to the respective health facility and IDSR focal person, and simultaneously to the national level, as well as district.   To strengthen the linkages between epidemiological and laboratory data, the case reported and the lab samples should have the same unique ID. Submission of the weekly summaries of the samples processed, and the types of samples as well as the results should be done whenever there is an outbreak, to assist in completion of the variables in the line list register During supervision at reporting sites, liaise with the Laboratory Focal Person to ensure that the Laboratorians, record correctly data for diseases under surveillance and also that there is an established register Make sure that the test results are linked with IDSR data at national and district levels The laboratory component of the IDSR Weekly or Monthly Summary Reporting Forms should be regularly updated immediately the respective disease lab results are ready Liaise with the animal sector, so as to have a comprehensive report also from Veterinary laboratory especially if they have recorded any animal information which might have risks to public health. The OHSP/eIDSR integration with the Laboratory Information Management System (LIMS) is encouraged to minimize the data transaction errors and shorten the result turnaround time. 2.4.6 Promote a multi-sectoral, One Health Approach with effective involvement from human, animal, and environmental health sectors as well as other relevant sectors to strengthen reporting Ensure implementation of the One Health approach to improve reporting of public health risks across all levels, with emphasis also at the community level.  Emphasize on strengthening the technical and community capacities of staff for all relevant sectors (including human physicians/nurses, veterinarians (for livestock or wildlife) and environmental inspectors.  Interoperable and interconnected platforms with emphasis on strengthening information systems within and between the human, animal, and environmental sectors would be ideal in enhancing real time information sharing. There should be a conscious effort to formalize the system of sharing information with other sectors i.e. human health, animal health, environmental health etc. The OHSP is the national digital platform to facilitate these surveillance needs with the One Health approach. The other multi-sectoral key actors to foster collaboration in reporting and assessment of public health risks include: private sector, civil society, faith-based organizations, defence and security forces, prisons, Internally Displaced Persons (IDP) and refugees’ camps, technical and financial partners and academic institutions and research institutions. Ensure that they are also included to strengthen routine reporting and analysis of public health risks and events. Data protection and security to protect patients confidentially  The public health community recognizes that there might be risks to both individuals and communities, if one uses name-based reporting of private health-related information.  To ensure protection of patient confidentiality and privacy, when reporting, use unique identifiers such as numbers instead of names and this will prevent identities from being inadvertently disclosed. The identifiable data should be however maintained where public health surveillance interventions occur and it is usually at the health facility level. Districts need to have guidelines on privacy and security of health data, which should be guided by the National level guidelines. Note: Use of names may be required during outbreak of infectious diseases for the purpose of contact tracing. Refer to Section 4 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines on contact tracing and recording. 2.6 Annexes to Section 2 Annex 2A: \\tIHR 2005 Decision Instrument Annex 2B:\\tAlgorithm of reporting immediate notifiable events/diseases Annex 2C:\\tCommunity Alert Form for reporting of event from community sources Annex 2D:\\tCommunity-Based Surveillance Suspected Diseases and Public Health Events Monthly Log Sheet Annex 2E: \\tReporting Structure for community alert and verification Annex 2F: \\tIDSR immediate case-based reporting form Annex 2G: \\tIDSR case based laboratory reporting form  Annex 2H: \\tIDSR weekly/monthly summary reporting form Annex 2I: \\tIDSR reports and data sharing log book Annex 2J: \\tDistrict level IDSR Data quality checklist Annex 2K: \\tMaternal deaths, Perinatal deaths reporting form, and Still and neonatal deaths summary reporting form Annex 2L:\\tWHO weekly reporting format Annex 2A: IHR 2005 Decision Instrument￼ ￼ Annex 2B: Algorithm of reporting immediate notifiable diseases/conditions/events Annex 2C: Community alert reporting form for ComBaS [Send this form immediately to your supervisor or nearby health facility] Instructions: This form is completed by a Community health worker or ComBaS key informant and submitted immediately to nearest health facility IDSR focal person when he or she identifies disease (s) or public health event as per the community case definition.

Organizing and analysing data is an important function of surveillance. Analysing data provides the information that is used to take relevant, timely and appropriate public health action. Analysis of surveillance data allows for: Observing trends over time and alerting health staff and relevant stakeholders about emergent events or unusual patterns Identifying geographic areas at higher risk Characterizing personal variables such as age, gender or occupation that place a person at higher risk for the disease or event. Monitoring and evaluation of Public Health interventions In general, analysing routine surveillance data should address the following questions: Have any priority diseases or other public health events of concern been detected during the reporting period (this week, for example)? Is an outbreak or unusual public health event suspected? Of the cases, deaths or events detected, how many were confirmed? Where did they occur? How does the observed situation compare to previous observation time periods this year or the previous year? For example, when compared to the start of the reporting period, is the problem increasing? Are the disease trends stable, improving or worsening? Is the reported surveillance information representative enough of the reporting site’s catchment area? Out of all the sites that should report, what proportion has actually reported? How timely were the data received from the reporting sites? What period (seasonality) is it occurring? Who is affected? Which occupational group are most at risk? Each site that collects or receives data should prepare and follow an analysis plan for analysing routine surveillance information (refer to Annex 3A of this section). This section describes how to receive surveillance data and analyse it by time, place and person. The analysis may be done electronically or manually. Methods for carrying out the analysis and steps for interpreting and summarizing the findings are also included. Information in this section can be applied at the national, district, health facility and community levels. 3.1 Receive, handle and store data from reporting sites The routine flow of surveillance data is usually from reporting sites to the next level up to the central level. A reporting site is a site which reports about surveillance and outbreak data to the next level. This includes all health facilities (public, private and quasi-governmental, faith based), standalone laboratories, and PoE. A reporting site also contains event reports from community surveillance and response. At the health facility level, both in-patient and out-patient departments are surveillance sites. The information collected from the site is compiled in standard forms (Weekly and Monthly IDSR Summary Reporting Forms, Case-based Investigation forms, Line listing forms etc.), analysed and then forwarded, to the district health management team. In areas where there is already an eIDSR system, data are entered electronically using a mobile phone or a computer, and the district health management team can access compiled information using a computer (Refer to Section 9 of the 3rd  Edition Malawi IDSR TG on eIDSR on more countries specific examples). In Malawi district team collects the data from the communities and health facilities in its catchment area and merge, aggregate, send and reports to the central level.  Adequate data protection and security must be ensured. Care must be taken not to leave documents containing personal health information related to notifiable conditions on work desks or anywhere they may be visible to unauthorized people. Hard copies of identified notifiable conditions should be stored in locked cabinets in a secure location. Data which is stored in a computer should be password-protected with appropriate restricted access. Network hardware and any back up or copies of notifiable conditions data must be password-protected and stored in a secure location.  3.1.1 Receive data Make a careful record of all data received from the reporting site. The Assistant Statistician/IDSR Focal Person at each level or reporting site where data are received should: Acknowledge receipt of the data/report. Log into an appropriate log book any data set or surveillance report received from any reporting site (Refer to Annex 2I in Section 2). Record in the log the date the data were received, what is the report about and who is the sender. Verify whether the data set arrived timely or was late. Check the completeness of the data set or reports i.e. the number of data sets/reports as against the number of expected data sets or reports Review the data quality; Verify whether the form (hard copy or electronic file) is filled out accurately  Ensure that the form is filled completely (e.g. no blanks). Check to be sure there are no discrepancies on the form. Verify from the reporting site (by phone, e-mail or text message) and correct any discrepancies Merge the data and store them in a database. For electronic surveillance refer to the section 9 of the this 3rd Edition Malawi TG on eIDSR 3.1.2 Enter and clean the data At each level where data is received (health facility, district or national), the IDSR focal person should always liaise with the Assistant Statistician to extract the priority IDSR diseases/events from the register and enter correctly into aggregated IDSR reporting forms while listing data from all the reporting sites. Troubleshooting and cleaning data prior to analysis is an important data management practice. Disease trends and maps will not be accurate if information about number of cases, time of onset, or geographic location of cases are missing. Use opportunities during supervisory visits to sensitize clinicians and laboratory staff about the importance of quality practices for recording patient information in patient log-books/register or reporting forms. Emphasize that patient logs are sources of data for reporting public health information and may play a role in detecting an unusual event or otherwise undetected public health issues. Ensure that Assistant Statistician or IDSR focal person knows the algorithm for reporting including reporting levels. Ensure also, they are recording rumours in the rumours log books.  The registers which are normally used in Malawi are the OPD and IPD registers and the IDSR Focal person should always liaise with the Assistant Statistician to extract the priority disease of IDSR from the registers. Data may be recorded and aggregated either manually or electronically if a computer is available. Regardless of the method, use the following practices: Update aggregate totals for each week or month that data are received. Record a zero when no cases were reported. If a space which should have been filled in is left blank/dash/not applicable, the next level may have an incorrect picture of the situation. They will not know if data are missing or if no cases were reported. Zero reporting allows the next level to know that surveillance did not detect a case of the particular disease or condition. Ensure that weekly totals include only those cases or deaths actually reported for that Epidemiological week (Monday to Sunday). Late reports from previous weeks should be entered with the relevant week and totals updated accordingly. Avoid duplicate entries by using the report or case record unique identifier to prevent, and also check for, multiple entries of the same records. Establish frequent contacts with the reporting sites in order to clarify issues of missing information / errors and address inconsistencies detected in the reporting. Ensure consistency and harmonization of data Ensure update of information on laboratory results is done by linking to the respective case record unique identifier Once the data have been received and entered into the aggregate forms, review them carefully to ensure no mistakes were made during entry. Since surveillance data informs decisions about disease control and prevention actions, there are important ethical, social and economic consequences if data are not entered and managed correctly or on time. During an outbreak, ensure data are collected using a line list. 3.2 Analyse data by time, place and person Findings from data analysis may trigger investigations and subsequent response to an outbreak, condition, or public health event. Data should be analysed by time, place and person (refer to Table 3.1). Table 3.1: Types of analysis, objectives, data display tools and methods Type of analysis\\ufdd0Objective\\ufdd0Method\\ufdd0Data Display Tools\\ufdd0Time\\ufdd0Detect abrupt or long- term changes in disease or unusual event occurrence, how many occurred, the seasonality and the period of time from exposure to onset of symptoms.\\ufdd0Compare the number of case reports received for the current period with the number received in a previous period (days, weeks, months, quarters, seasons or years)\\ufdd0Record summary totals in a table or on a line graph or histogram or sequential maps\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0Place\\ufdd0Identify where cases are occurring (for example, to identify high risk area or locations of populations at risk for the disease)\\ufdd0Plot cases on a map and look for clusters or relationships between the location of the cases and the health event being investigated. (e.g. cases near a river, cases near a market)\\ufdd0Plot cases on a spot map of the district or area affected during an outbreak. \\u2029Dot density analysis can also be used to depict the number of cases by geographic location\\u2029NB: The information can also be presented in a table or a bar chart, but plotting cases in a map will assist in quick assessment and allow prompt intervention\\ufdd0Person\\ufdd0Describe reasons for changes in disease occurrence, how it occurred, who is at greatest risk for the disease, and potential risk factors\\ufdd0Depending on the disease, characterize cases according to the data reported for case-based surveillance such as age, sex, place of work, immunization status, school attendance, and other known risk factors for the diseases\\ufdd0Extract specific data about the population affected and summarize in a table or a bar chart or a pie chart 3.2.1 Analyse data by time Data from this type of analysis is usually shown on a graph. The number or rate of cases or deaths is placed on the vertical or y-axis. The time period being evaluated is placed along the horizontal or x-axis. Events that occurred that might affect the particular disease being analysed can also be noted on the graph. Graphs can show how many cases and deaths have occurred in a given time. It is easier to see changes in the number of cases and deaths by using a graph, especially for large numbers of cases or showing cases over a period of time. Graphs are made with lines (a trend line) or bars (a bar graph or histogram) to measure the number of cases over time. How to make a graph is described in Annex 3B of this Section. ￼ Figure 3.1; Example of line graph: Weekly trend of reported Cerebrospinal Meningitis cases, Chinsapo_2, Epidemiological weeks 1-9, 2017 ￼ Figure 3.2 Trend line by week, cholera cases, Nsanje District ￼ Figure 3.3 Example of a bar graph: Example: Age distribution of diarrhoeal cases during an outbreak in Kasungu Town, 2004 Using a histogram Prepare a histogram using data from the case reporting forms and line lists. Plot cases on the histogram according to the date of onset. As the histogram is developed, it will demonstrate an epidemic curve.  The title of the graph should include the name of the geographical location been described. Highlight significant events on the histogram with arrows. For example, review the log of reported outbreaks to highlight the dates when: Onset of the first (or index) case The health facility notified the district The first case was seen at the health facility The district began the case investigation lab confirmation of the outbreak A response initiated The district notified the higher level The results of this analysis allow users of this information to look back at the outbreak and answer questions such as when were patients exposed to the illness, the length of the incubation period, type of the source, duration between detection and confirmation of the outbreak and transmission pattern of the illness and likely time of exposure to the causative agent. ￼ Figure 3.4 Example of histogram (epidemic curve): Reported cholera cases, Nsanje District Epidemiologic week 1 - 31, 2001 ￼ Figure 3.5 Cases of Aflatoxicosis by date of onset of symptoms, Mitundu and Msundwe, Lilongwe, 2016 3.2.2 Analyse data by place Analysing data by place provides insight about where a disease is occurring. Establishing and regularly updating a spot map of cases for selected diseases can give ideas as to where, how, and why the disease is spreading. The dot density will give the total number of cases per defined geographic area. Use the place of residence on the case reporting forms or line list to plot and describe: Clusters of cases occurring in a particular area Travel patterns that relate to the method of transmission for this disease Common sources of infection for these cases. Use manual methods or open source Geographic Information System (GIS) software, such as Health Mapper, QGIS, or Geographic Information Software (GIS) to create maps to use as part of routine analysis of disease surveillance of data. On a map of the area where cases occurred, mark the following: Roads, water sources, location of specific communities and other factors related to the transmission risk for the disease or condition under investigation. For example, a map for neonatal tetanus includes locations of traditional birth attendants and health facilities where mothers deliver infants. Location of the patients’ residences or most relevant geographical characteristic for this disease or condition (for example, by village, neighbourhood, work camp, or refugee settlement). Another example is when mapping young patients during a meningitis outbreak; remember to locate the school that the patients attend or other locations as appropriate to the disease or condition being investigated. Please see section 11 of this 3rd Edition Malawi TG, for disease specific guidelines for specific recommendations for analysing data by place.  ￼ Figure 3.6 Example of district spot map showing location of suspected and confirmed cases ￼ Figure 3.7 Example of a spot map using a GIS software showing concentration of cases along one particular area 3.2.3 Analyze data by person Analysis by person describes the population with the condition as well as those at risk of contracting the condition or being exposed to factors associated with it. These factors may reveal important clues to understanding the disease, why it occurred and how to control it, thus preventing further spread. Make a distribution of the cases by each of the person variables in the reporting form. For example, compare the total number and proportion of suspected and confirmed cases by: Age group Sex Occupation Urban and rural residences Vaccination status Risk factors  Outcomes Final classification Use disease-specific information to decide which variables to compare. For example, if information has been collected about cholera outbreak, specify the age groupings that are targeted by PHIM. Compare the age groupings of cases detected in young children (age 5 to 14 years) and cases in adults (age 15 and over). Analysis by person is usually recommended for describing the population at risk. This analysis is easiest when the data are case-based. Identifying numerators and denominators A simple count of cases does not provide all of the information needed to understand the impact of a disease on the community, health facility or district. Simple percentages and rates are useful for comparing information reported to the district. The first step in analysing person data is to identify the numerator and denominator for calculating percentages and rates. The numerator is the number of specific events being measured (such as the actual number of cases or deaths of a given disease, for example the number of cases of measles that occurred during the year in school age children) The denominator is the number of people in the population in which the cases or deaths of a given disease occurred, or the population at risk. Using simple percentages Simple percentages can be calculated to compare information from populations of different sizes. For example: Health facility\\ufdd0Number of measles cases this year in school age children\\ufdd0A\\ufdd042\\ufdd0B\\ufdd030 By looking only at the number of reported cases, it appears that a higher occurrence of measles cases occurred in health facility A. But when the number of reported cases at each health facility is compared to the total number of school-aged children living in each catchment area, then the situation becomes clearer. Health facility\\ufdd0Number of school-aged children living in the catchment area\\ufdd0A\\ufdd01,150\\ufdd0B\\ufdd0600 By calculating the incidence (i.e. number of new cases) of measles cases during the last 12 months in school-aged children. The numerator is the number of new cases that occurred over one year. The denominator is the number of school-aged children at risk in each catchment area. The measure obtained is called incidence rate or attack rate.  In this example, the incidence rate is higher in health facility B than in health facility A. The IDSR focal person can compare the impact of the illness on each facility. The facility In-charge/IDSR focal person can also use similar analysis to compare illnesses in different villages. Health facility\\ufdd0Incidence of measles per 100 school-aged children during last 12 months\\ufdd0A\\ufdd04%\\ufdd0B\\ufdd05% 3.2.4 Make a table for person analysis For each priority disease or condition under surveillance, use a table to analyse characteristics of the patients who are becoming ill. A table is a set of data organized in columns and rows. The purpose of a table is to present the data in a simple way. For surveillance and monitoring, use a table to show the number of cases and deaths from a given disease that occurred in a given time. To make a table: Decide what information you want to show on the table. For example, consider analysis of measles cases and deaths by age group Decide how many columns and rows you will need. Add an extra row at the bottom and an extra column at the right to show totals as needed. In the example, you will need a row for each age group, and a column for each variable such as age group or cases and deaths. Label all the rows and columns, including measurements of time. In the example below, the analysis is done yearly. Analysis of person is also recommended for analysis of outbreak data. Record the total number of cases and deaths as indicated in each row. Check to be sure the correct numbers are in the correct row or column. Age group\\ufdd0Number   of reported measles cases per year\\ufdd0Number of deaths per year\\ufdd00 - 4 years\\ufdd040\\ufdd04\\ufdd05-14 years\\ufdd09\\ufdd01\\ufdd015 years and older\\ufdd01\\ufdd00\\ufdd0Age unknown\\ufdd028\\ufdd00\\ufdd0Total\\ufdd078\\ufdd05 3.2.5 Calculate the percentage of cases occurring within a given age group When the summary totals for each age group are entered, one analysis that can be done is to find out what percent of the cases occurred in a given age group. To calculate this percentage: Identify the total number of cases reported within each age group from the summary data for which time or person characteristics are known. (For example, there are 40 cases in children 0 - 4 years of age.) Calculate the total number of cases for the time or characteristic being measured. (In this example, there are 78 cases whose age is known.) Divide the total number of cases within each age group by the total number of reported cases. (For example, for children age 0-4 years, divide 40 by 78. The answer is 0.51.) Multiply the answer by 100 to calculate the percent. (Multiply 0.51 X 100. The answer is 51 %.) Age group\\ufdd0Number of reported cases\\ufdd0% of reported cases in each age group\\ufdd00-4 years\\ufdd040\\ufdd051%\\ufdd05-14 years\\ufdd09\\ufdd012%\\ufdd015 years and older \\ufdd0                 1\\ufdd01%\\ufdd0Age unknown\\ufdd028\\ufdd036%\\ufdd0Total\\ufdd078\\ufdd0100% 3.2.6 Calculate the attack rates The\\xa0attack rate\\xa0is the measure of frequency of\\xa0morbidity, or speed of spread, in an at risk population. An attack rate describes the risk of getting the\\xa0disease\\xa0during a specified period, such as the duration of an outbreak. Attack rate is defined as the frequency with which an event (such as a new case of illness) occurs in a population at risk over a specified period, and is usually calculated in an outbreak scenario. It is expressed per population at risk; for example: 4.5/100 000 population.  EXAMPLE: 16 cases of cholera in village with a population of 800. Attack rate =16/800 =0.02 0.02 x 100 = 2.0, i.e. 2 cases per 100 population = 2.0% During an outbreak, these data will need to be updated frequently (often daily) to see if the information being received changes the ideas regarding the causes of the outbreak. 3.2.7 Calculate a case fatality rate  A case fatality rate helps to: know the proportion of deaths among cases Indicate whether a case is identified and managed promptly Indicate any problems with case-management once the disease has been diagnosed Identify a more virulent, new or drug-resistant pathogen. Indicate poor quality of care or no medical care. Compare the quality of case management between different catchment areas, cities, and districts. Assess health seeking behaviours Identify underlying conditions to severe diseases e.g. immune deficiency Public health programs can impact the case fatality rate by ensuring that cases are promptly detected and good quality case management takes place. Some disease control recommendations for specific diseases include reducing the case fatality rate as a target for measuring whether the outbreak response has been effective. To calculate a case fatality rate: Calculate the total number of deaths. (In the example of the measles data, there are a total of 5 deaths.) Divide the total number of deaths by the total number of reported cases. (For example, the total number of reported cases is 78. The number of deaths is 5. So divide 5 by 78. 5 ÷ 78 is 0.06.) Multiply the answer times 100 (0.06 X 100 equals 6%).

They help surveillance and program managers answer the question, “When should I take action, and what will that action be?” Information on establishing thresholds is in Section 4.1 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines. Thresholds are based on information from two different sources: In some instances, there might be already a situation analysis which has been done to describe the risks for occurrence of a particular diseases, and who the people at risk might be and there is already a described action that needs to be done once the risks have been identified to prevent a wider outbreak International recommendations from technical and disease control program experts. These guidelines discuss two types of thresholds: an alert threshold and an epidemic threshold. Not every disease or condition uses both types of thresholds, although each disease or condition has a point where a problem must be reported and an action taken. An alert threshold suggests to health staff and the surveillance team that further investigation is needed. Depending on the disease or condition, an alert threshold is reached when there is one suspected case (as for an epidemic-prone disease or for a disease targeted for elimination or eradication) or when there is an unexplained increase for any disease or unusual pattern seen over a period of time in weekly or monthly summary reporting.  Action (epidemic) threshold triggers a definite response. It marks the specific data or investigation finding that alerts an action beyond confirming or clarifying the problem. Possible actions include communicating laboratory confirmation to affected health centres, implementing an emergency response such as an immunization activity, community awareness campaign, or improved infection control practices in the health care setting. Several thresholds have been proposed for action based on disease surveillance findings. For rare diseases or diseases targeted for eradication, detection of a single case suggests an epidemic. In such situations, one case is unusual and is a serious event. This is because these rare or targeted diseases have the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates. In other situations, a number of cases will trigger a response. For example, the epidemic threshold for bacterial meningitis in countries of the meningitis belt is 10 suspected cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week and under 30,000 inhabitants is 5 suspected cases in one week or doubling of the number of cases in a three-week period (Minimum of 2 cases in one week), and the alert threshold is 3 suspected cases per 30,000 - 100,000 inhabitants per week and under 30,000 inhabitants is 2 suspected cases per week or an increased incidence compared to previous non-epidemic years (Source: Weekly Epidemiological Record No 51/52, 577-588, 19 December 2014( http://www.who.int/wer). The epidemic threshold for malaria in some countries is 3rd Quartile of confirmed malaria cases for the past 5 years; Alert threshold is 2nd quartile/Median of confirmed malaria cases In practice, the national level is responsible for communicating the thresholds for priority diseases to all reporting sites in the health system. This facilitates use of surveillance information for action at the level where it is collected. Periodically, surveillance thresholds are assessed and reset at national or international levels according to the observed trends of the diseases, events or conditions under surveillance. Suggested thresholds for taking action in specific diseases or conditions are discussed Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines. 3.4 Draw conclusions from the findings to generate information (i) Routinely (weekly, monthly or quarterly) gather or present the graphs, maps and tables and meet with the district health team or relevant stakeholders to review analysis results and discuss the findings.  (ii) Systematically review the findings following the district’s analysis plan (see Annex 3A) if one has been prepared (iii) Make sure you also correlate the analysis you have done with other data sources, like from animals (domestic or wildlife), or the environment to assist in correct interpretation of your findings. For example, if you have seen a number of human rabies cases, it will be important to get information from the animal sector on the status of any current bite investigations, quarantined animals, or dogs vaccinated. (iv) Consider quality of the data when interpreting results for example;   missing data values (completeness per month, per event)  inconsistencies (between linked data elements - validation)  arithmetic errors (in correlation & aggregation)  obvious fluctuations (sharp increase or decrease per month, per event)  It is important in a system whereby eIDSR has been established, to ensure that there are features to improve data quality and these might include: Data input validation Maximum and Minimum values Validation rules (v) At a minimum, review the findings to: Assess whether the situation is improving or not, and Make comparison of the observed data to the expected data Consider possible explanations for an apparent increase in cases Has there been a change in the number of health facilities reporting information?  Has there been a change in reporting procedures or surveillance system? Has there been any change in the case definition that is being used to report the disease or condition?  Is the increase or decrease a seasonal variation?  Has there been a change in screening or treatment programs, or in community outreach or health education activities that would result in more people seeking care?  Has there been a recent immigration or emigration to the area or an increase in refugee populations?    Has there been any change in the quality of services being offered at the facility (for      example, lines are shorter, health staffs are more helpful, drugs are available, clinic fees are charged)?  Is there an increase or improvement in laboratory testing / diagnostic procedure? Is there an increase awareness of disease in the public? e.g., mass vaccination  campaign and awareness of a particular disease will lead to increase of cases presented to the facility Backlog of cases being reported which were supposed to be reported earlier. 3.5 Summarize and use the analysis to improve public health action Prepare and share with all stakeholders including affected communities who need this information, a concise action-oriented summary reports of the surveillance findings. Use simple tables, graphs and maps, with clear and short description, interpretation, comments and recommendations. Make statements that describe the conclusions you have drawn from the surveillance data analysis results. Use them to take action to: Conduct an investigation to find out why there is an increase/decrease in the number of cases. Collaborate with specific disease reduction programs to intensify surveillance if an alert threshold has been crossed, Advocate with political and community leaders for more resources, if a lack of resources is identified as a cause for the increased number of cases. Information sharing is an important surveillance function and a powerful mechanism of coordination. It motivates the staffs who send reports and builds partnership through the transparency that information sharing displays. Thus, it is important to share analysis results and provide feedback on time. Please refer to Section 7 and 8 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR TG for information and examples about communication and sharing feedback. 3.6 Annexes for Section 3 Annex 3A: \\tMake a plan for routine analysis of surveillance information and an example of analysis plan for cholera in Country A, 2017  Annex 3B: \\tHow to manually make a line graph Annex 3A: Make a plan for routine analysis of surveillance information A minimum plan for routine analysis of surveillance information should include the following information which could be presented as tables, graphs and maps. Calculate completeness and timeliness of reporting Monitoring whether surveillance reports are received on time and if all reporting sites have reported is an essential first step in the routine analysis of the surveillance system. This assists the district (or other level) surveillance team in identifying silent areas (areas where health events may be occurring but which are not being reported) or reporting sites that need assistance in transmitting their reports. It also depicts how representative the data is for the specific level. Calculate district (or other level) totals by week (or by month). Update the total number of reported cases and deaths for the whole year. This is summary information that helps to describe what has happened in the particular reporting period. Prepare cumulative totals of cases, deaths and case fatality rates since the beginning of the reporting period. Use geographic variables (such as hospitals, residence, reporting site, neighbourhoods, village and so on) to analyse the distribution of cases by place. This is information that will help to identify high risk areas. Analyse disease trends for at least the diseases of highest priority in your district. Monitor the trends for cases, deaths, and case fatality rates to identify any unusual increases or disease patterns. Data validation and quality analysis.

However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats.  The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi subsequently adapted in 2014. Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. Emerging and re-emerging diseases and conditions pose a threat to the country’s health security.  Responding to health emergencies remains a major challenge, as shown by recent health emergencies in the country as well as the African region, the unprecedented Ebola Virus Disease of 2014, the ongoing Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic. Specifically, challenges in capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats have been identified. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using the Third Edition of the guidelines for IDSR as revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018 and adapted to our context in 2020. It is worth noting that, many Public Health Events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate. To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to  implement these IDSR technical guidelines. These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Therefore, it is important that we scale up and fully implement this third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in the country as they explicitly describe what needs to be established at each level of the health system in order to detect, confirm and respond to diseases, conditions and health events that are responsible for  illness, deaths and disability in local communities. The cost of good public health surveillance as a public health good is relatively very low compared to many other strategies. Let us all embrace these IDSR technical guidelines to strengthen capacities for preparedness, alert and response for health security in the country. These guidelines are to be used by all relevant multisectoral stakeholders at all levels as general reference for surveillance activities, set of standard definitions for threshold levels that initiate action for responding to specific diseases, stand-alone reference for level-specific responsibilities, resource for developing training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of surveillance activities, and as a guide for improving early detection and response of epidemic prone diseases. Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.

It provides disease/event/condition specific guidance to: Take action to respond to alerts and action thresholds, Identify surveillance goals and objectives,  Surveillance data analysis and interpretation, Prepare to use the district analysis workbook or database, Standard case definitions for reporting diseases/event s/conditions. When adapting these guidelines each country will create its list of priority diseases/events/conditions depending on the local epidemiological situation. The priority list could vary from country to country depending on national policy and resources. This section is intended as a rapid reference. When additional information is required, please use the detailed references listed in the summary. The table below shows how information is organized in this section. Priority disease/event/condition for IDSR Background\\ufdd0In this sub-section, you will find general information about:\\u2029The disease or event, the causative agent, geographic range affected and other epidemiologic information.\\u2029Transmission routes such as person-to-person, unprotected contact with infectious body fluids or contaminated materials, vector-borne, and so on.\\u2029Why the disease/event is a priority for surveillance. For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness, \\u2029General and specific risk factors in African countries.\\u2029Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team.\\u2029\\ufdd0Surveillance Goal\\ufdd0This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action.\\u2029\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event.\\u2029Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing.\\u2029\\ufdd0Respond to alert threshold\\u2029Some diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem. \\u2029For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.\\u2029\\u2029For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.\\u2029\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.\\u2029For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.\\u2029\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).\\ufdd0Laboratory confirmation\\ufdd0In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.\\ufdd0Reference\\ufdd0Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease. Most are available from the WHO website. Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome Background\\ufdd0Acute haemorrhagic fever syndromes can be attributable to Ebola and Marburg viral diseases (Filoviridae);    Lassa fever (arenaviridae), Rift Valley fever (RVF) and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) (Bunyaviridae); dengue (dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)) and yellow fever (Flaviviridae); and other viral, bacterial or rickettsial diseases with potential to produce epidemics.\\u2029All cases of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome whether single or in clusters, should be immediately notified without waiting for the causal agent to be identified.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Early detection of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the cause of all suspected cases. Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing. During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used (e.g. case definitions for Ebola-Marburg, CCHF, RVF, Lassa, DHF, and yellow fever).\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case: Acute onset of fever of less than 3 weeks duration in a severely ill patient/ or a dead person AND any 2 of the following; haemorrhagic or purpuric rash; epistaxis (nose bleed); haematemesis (blood in vomit); haemoptysis (blood in sputum); blood in stool; other haemorrhagic symptoms and no known predisposing factors for haemorrhagic manifestations OR clinical suspicion of any of the viral diseases.\\u2029Probable case: A suspected case with epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak, but laboratory specimens are not available or awaited\\u2029Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation.\\u2029Note: During an outbreak, case definitions may be changed to correspond to the local event. It is important to note that during outbreaks, most cases might not show haemorrhagic manifestation, a proper history taking is crucial Respond to alert threshold\\ufdd0 If a single case is suspected:\\u2029Report case-based information immediately to the appropriate levels.\\u2029Suspected cases should be isolated from other patients/people and strict infection prevention procedures should be implemented. Standard precautions should be enhanced throughout the health care setting and in communities.\\u2029Treat and manage the patient with supportive care.\\u2029Collect the appropriate specimen while observing strict infection prevention and control procedures to confirm the case.\\u2029Complete a laboratory request form, use triple packaging of the specimens (see detailed SOP for triple packaging) and mark well the containers to warn of a potential laboratory biosafety risk\\u2029Conduct case-contact tracing and follow-up and active case search for additional cases (See detailed SOP for contact tracing and follow up).\\u2029Begin or enhance death reporting and surveillance; as well as screening procedures for fever and VHD related symptoms\\u2029 Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0If a single case is confirmed:\\u2029Maintain strict viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) infection prevention and control (IPC) practices* throughout the outbreak.\\u2029Mobilize the community for early detection and care and conduct community education about how the disease is transmitted and how to implement IPC in the home care setting and during funerals and burials. Consider social distancing strategies.\\u2029Conduct case-contact follow-up and active searches for additional cases that may not come to the health care setting.\\u2029Request additional help from other levels as needed.\\u2029Establish an isolation ward or treatment centre to handle additional cases that may come to the health centre and ensure strict IPC measures to avoid transmission in health care settings.\\u2029Suspected cases should be isolated and treated for more common conditions with similar symptoms, which might include malaria, typhoid, louse borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Ensure a barrier is instituted between suspected and confirmed cases.\\u2029Provide psychosocial support for the family, community and staff.\\u2029Consider quarantine for high risk contacts with home support during the incubation period and ensure daily follow up of their movements.\\u2029There are promising vaccine candidates under development for some VHDs that might be useful to be used in the event of outbreak in a ring vaccination approach and for health care workers.\\u2029Treat conservatively the symptoms which might be presented; severe cases require intensive support care; if dehydrated ensure fluid replacement with fluids that contain electrolytes.\\u2029A range of potential treatment options including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies are currently being evaluated,\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths. Analyse age and sex distribution. Assess risk factors and plan outbreak response interventions accordingly.\\u2029Time:Graph cases and deaths daily/weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during the outbreak.\\u2029Place:Map locations of cases’ households and work sites. If you have a GPS gadget, this will add to understand exact location of the cases; as well as contacts. Laboratory confirmation: Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome\\ufdd0Diagnostic test\\ufdd0Laboratory confirmed cases must test positive for the virus antigen, either by detection of virus RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR), or by detection of IgM antibodies directed against Ebola/Marburg, CCHF, Lassa or West Nile Fever \\ufdd0Specimen\\ufdd0For ELISA: Whole blood, serum or plasma\\u2029\\u2029For RT-PCR: Whole blood or blood clot, serum/plasma or tissue\\u2029For immunohisto-chemistry: Skin or tissue specimens from fatal cases\\u2029NB: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)o theoretically can be performed in any health care setting and without additional equipment, however, use of an RDT may result in both false positive and false negative test results. A nucleic-acid based (e.g., PCR) diagnostic assay, such as GeneXpert, must be used to confirm the RDT result. Recent guidance from WHO recommends that antigen detection RDT’s for VHDs have no role in the routine management of VHDs in settings where PCR testing is available.  However, they may have utility in settings without laboratory infrastructure and where specimens cannot be rapidly transported to a diagnostic laboratory, if their benefits and limitations are understood.\\ufdd0When to collect the specimen\\ufdd0Collect specimen from all suspected patients.\\u2029All cases must be investigated, with contact tracing. Blood samples and appropriate clinical specimens must be collected to confirm a diagnosis as rapidly as possible.\\ufdd0How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen HANDLE AND TRANSPORT SPECIMENS FROM SUSPECTED VHF PATIENTS WITH EXTREME CAUTION. WEAR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND USE FULL PPE.\\u2029For ELISA or PCR:\\u2029Refrigerate serum or clot\\u2029Freeze (-20oC or colder) tissue specimens for virus isolation\\u2029For Immunohistochemistry:\\u2029Fix skin snip specimen in formalin. Specimen can be stored up to 6 weeks. The specimen is not infectious once it is in formalin.\\u2029Store at room temperature.

Evans, A.S. (ed). Plenum Medical Book Company, New York Acute and chronic viral hepatitis Background\\ufdd0Viral hepatitis A and viral hepatitis E\\u2029Enterically transmitted hepatitis A virus (HAV) and hepatitis E virus (HEV) are a worldwide problem.\\u2029Common source epidemics have been related to contaminated water and to contamination via infected food handlers.\\u2029In general, both HAV and HEV are self-limiting viral infections; case fatality is normally low (0.1 – 0.3%). Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease.\\u2029Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route.\\u2029Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water.\\u2029Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C:\\u2029Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus.\\u2029Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon. \\u2029Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year. \\u2029Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person. \\u2029Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood. The major causes of HCV infection worldwide are use of unscreened blood transfusions and re-use of needles and syringes that have not been adequately sterilized.\\u2029Prevention and control measures for hepatitis B and C include transfusion safety, safe and appropriate use of injections and vaccination (hepatitis B). Screening and early treatment are efficient modes of secondary prevention.\\u2029To address the increasing burden of viral hepatitis, in 2016, African member states adopted Prevention, Care and Treatment of viral hepatitis in the African Region: Framework for action 2016-2020\\u2029There is no specific treatment for acute viral hepatitis.

Report of CIOMS/WHO Working Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance. Geneva, Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences, 2012 Anthrax (human) Background\\ufdd0Anthrax is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a Gram positive rod-shaped bacterium. A. It is transmitted from infected domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, pigs and others) or wild game animals to humans by direct contact or indirect contact with animals or their products.\\u2029The incubation period typically ranges from 1 to 7 days, but may be longer (up to two to three weeks for cutaneous anthrax and up to 42 days for inhalation anthrax). Persons exposed to occupational hazards include those handling infected carcasses and those employed in the processing of bones, hides, wool and other animal products. Persons may also become infected by handling or consuming meat from animals that are sick with or have died of the disease. Biting flies have been reported to transmit the disease from infected animals to humans however how readily or often this occurs is unknown.\\u2029Human anthrax is a serious problem in several countries and has potential for explosive outbreaks (especially the gastrointestinal form that is contracted from eating infected meat); while pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax is mainly occupational, the threat of biological warfare attacks should not be forgotten. Anthrax has a serious impact on the trade of animal products.\\u2029The control of anthrax is based on its prevention in livestock. Programmes based only on prevention in humans are costly and likely to be ineffective except for those industrially exposed.\\u2029There is an effective vaccine for those persons considered at risk for occupational exposure, and successful vaccines are used for livestock, particularly for herds with ongoing exposure to contaminated soil or vegetation.\\u2029In most countries anthrax is a notifiable disease.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0To detect outbreaks.\\u2029To monitor control and prevention programmes Standard case definition: Anthrax (Human)\\ufdd0 Suspected case\\u2029 Any person with acute onset characterized by several clinical forms which are:\\u2029Cutaneous form: Any person with skin lesion evolving over 1 to 6 days from a papular through a vesicular stage, to a depressed black eschar invariably accompanied by oedema that may be mild to extensive.\\u2029Gastro-intestinal: Any person with abdominal distress characterized by nausea, vomiting, anorexia and followed by fever\\u2029Pulmonary (inhalation): any person with brief prodromal resembling acute viral respiratory illness, followed by rapid onset of hypoxia, dyspnoea and high temperature, with X-ray evidence of mediastinal widening\\u2029Meningeal: Any person with acute onset of high fever possibly with convulsions, loss of consciousness, meningeal signs and symptoms; commonly noted in all systemic infections, but may present without any other clinical symptoms of anthrax.\\u2029 AND has an epidemiological link to confirmed or suspected animal cases or contaminated animal products\\ufdd0 Confirmed case\\u2029 A confirmed case of anthrax in a human can be defined as a clinically compatible case of cutaneous,   \\u2029 inhalational or gastrointestinal illness that is laboratory-confirmed by:\\u2029isolation of B. anthracis from an affected tissue or site; OR\\u2029Other laboratory evidence of B. anthracis infection based on at least two supportive laboratory tests.\\u2029 Note: it may not be possible to demonstrate B. anthracis in clinical specimens if the patient has been treated with antimicrobial agents.

In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. \\u2029Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.\\u2029Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.\\u2029Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.\\u2029Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.\\u2029Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.\\u2029Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.\\u2029During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended\\u2029The current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared.

The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.\\u2029The word \"Chikungunya\" is Makonde for \"that which bends up,\" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.\\u2029Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0 Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification.\\u2029 Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\u2029\\ufdd0Acute clinical case\\u2029Clinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND \\u2029Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    OR\\u2029Laboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)\\u2029Atypical case\\u2029Clinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.\\u2029Severe acute case\\u2029Clinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalization\\u2029Suspected and confirmed chronic cases\\u2029Suspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  \\u2029Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test\\u2029\\u2029   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age  \\u2029     group).\\u2029  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.\\ufdd0 Respond to alert threshold\\ufdd0If Chikungunya cases are suspected:\\u2029Report case-based information immediately to the next level\\u2029Collect specimens for confirming the cases\\u2029Conduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmission\\u2029Manage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0If Chikungunya cases are confirmed\\u2029Symptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices.

The disease is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route; that is through eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\\u2029Cholera causes over 100 000 deaths per year. It may produce rapidly progressive epidemics or worldwide pandemics. In endemic areas, sporadic cases (less than 5% of all non-outbreak-related diarrhoea cases) and small outbreaks may occur.\\u2029Incubation period is from a few hours to 5 days, usually in the range of from 2 to 3 days.\\u2029There has been a resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, where over 80% of the world’s cases occurred in 1999. The majority of cases occurred from January through April. In 2016, globally, 38 countries reported a total of 132 121 cases. Of cases reported globally, 54% were from Africa, 13% from Asia and 32% from Hispaniola. Imported cases were reported in 9 countries.\\u2029Cholera may cause severe dehydration in only a few hours. In untreated patients with severe dehydration, the case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50%. If patients present at the health facility and correct treatment is received, the CFR is usually less than 1%. At least 90% of the cases are mild, and they remain undiagnosed.\\u2029Risk factors: eating or drinking contaminated foods such as uncooked seafood or shellfish from estuarine waters, lack of continuous access to safe water and food supplies, attending large gatherings of people including ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, contact with persons who died of cholera.\\u2029Other enteric diarrhoea may cause watery diarrhoea, especially in children less than 5 years of age.

Dengue is caused by four serologically distinct, but closely related viruses: dengue virus (DENV) 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Flaviviridae family.\\u2029Dengue fever is an emerging pandemic that has spread globally during the past 30 years as a result of changes in human ecology. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world, predominately in urban and semi-urban areas. During dengue epidemics, infection rates among those who have not been previously exposed to the virus are often 40% to 50%, but can reach 80% to 90%.\\u2029Dengue fever is a severe, influenza-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults, but seldom causes death. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a potentially deadly complication that has become a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children in Asia. There is good evidence that sequential infection with the different serotypes of dengue virus increases the risk of more severe disease that can result in dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and death.\\u2029Epidemic dengue activity in Africa has mostly been classical dengue fever caused by DENV-1 and DENV-2 without associated mortality. The first major outbreak of DENV-3 in Africa was documented in Mozambique in 1984-1985. During this outbreak, most patients experienced secondary infections and 2 deaths were attributed to DHF and shock. In 2008, yellow fever and DENV-3 were found to be co-circulating in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, however, no severe dengue cases or deaths attributable to dengue were identified.\\u2029There is no specific treatment for dengue, but appropriate medical care frequently saves the lives of patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever.\\u2029Infected humans are the main carriers and multipliers of the virus, serving a source of the virus for uninfected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes which maintain the urban dengue transmission cycle.

Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations.\\u2029The most common form is Type 2 diabetes that represents more than 85% of the cases. Other forms are less common such as Type 1 (10% of cases), specific diabetes and gestational diabetes (5% of cases).\\u2029The risk factors that affect the onset of diabetes are well-known. They comprise non-modifiable factors like old age (over 45 years of age), family history, and the causes of diabetes in pregnancy. Modifiable risk factors for diabetes are obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption.\\u2029The global prevalence in 2000 was estimated at 2.8%, with projections of 4.8% by 2030. The total number of persons affected will rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 if no action is taken. Annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide is estimated at more than one million.\\u2029Diabetes is no longer considered rare in Africa. Recent estimates based on the WHO STEP-wise approach for monitoring the risk factors of non-communicable diseases indicate prevalence of between 1% and 20%. In some countries such as Mauritius, it reaches 20%.\\u2029The rate of limb amputations due to diabetes varies from 1.4% to 6.7% of diabetic foot cases. In some African countries, the mortality rate is higher than 40 per 10,000 inhabitants.\\u2029In the African Region, efforts made to create an environment that enhances the fight against diabetes include adoption of resolutions on non-communicable diseases in 2000, cardiovascular diseases strategy in 2005, and diabetes mellitus strategy in 2007.

ISBN 92 4 068750 5 Dracunculiasis (Guinea Worm Disease)  Background\\ufdd0Dracunculiasis is commonly known as Guinea worm disease. It is caused by a large nematode, a disabling parasite that emerges through the skin of the infected person.\\u2029This is an old disease, known since antiquity, inflicting an excruciating pain on affected individuals and usually causing temporary disability, leaving many patients with unfortunate socio-economic consequences. It is transmitted through ingestion of water containing a crustacean (cyclops) which is infested by an immature form (larvae) of the nematode. The Cyclops is found in stagnant surface water sources (ponds, traditional shallow wells). The female nematode discharges larvae from the host’s skin when there is contact with water. The incubation period is usually between 10 to 14 months. There is no treatment or vaccine against the disease.\\u2029Successful disease elimination strategies conducted by the endemic countries and an international coalition of partners has pushed Dracunculiasis towards eradication. During 2017, only 30 cases of Guinea worm disease worldwide were reported to WHO, compared to 892 000 in 1989, showing a reduction of 99.99%.\\u2029In 1989, the disease was endemic in 20 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Chad, Ghana, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Senegal, Togo, Uganda and Yemen.\\u2029Africa remains the only affected continent, with 5 countries having reported infection emanating from indigenous transmission of the parasite either in human and/or in animal in 2018: Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan.\\u2029Since, 2012, emerging worms from animals, mostly dogs, and in a few instances, cats and baboons, have been reported in some of the remaining endemic countries and confirmed in the WHO Collaborating Centre at CDC for Dracunculiasis Eradication laboratory, as Dracunculus medinensis. Accordingly, dracunculiasis eradication, which was previously based on interrupting transmission in human, will now include interrupting transmission in both human and animal hosts.2 Surveillance goal: Dracunculiasis\\ufdd0Active detection and containment of cases at the community level and immediate reporting to the health centre, with immediate notification to the health district, regional and national level. This should subsequently be followed by weekly and monthly reporting of cases to the next level.\\u2029In zones where local transmission of Guinea worm has been interrupted, maintain active searches for cases in high-risk areas and promptly follow-up and investigate all rumours of dracunculiasis (within 24 hours of notification) reported through the national surveillance system and/or directly by community members.\\u2029Report all imported cases to countries or areas of origin for further follow up investigation to trace the source of infection for further action.\\u2029Integrate dracunculiasis surveillance into National Surveillance systems and continue to report immediately/weekly/monthly, and also according to national reporting system.\\u2029Use opportunities of other community-based health activities (e. g. NID campaigns for Polio and other vaccinations, NTD Mapping, Mass drug administration, ITN and other health commodities distribution, etc.), to conduct active case search for dracunculiasis, and document results.\\u2029Continue publicity of the cash reward for reporting Dracunculiasis\\u2029Systematically document and properly store information /surveillance data related to Guinea worm surveillance, to serve as evidence for future certification, and beyond until Global eradication is declared.\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0Standard case definitions: Dracunculiasis\\ufdd0 Rumour\\u2029Information about the occurrence of Guinea worm disease (Dracunculiasis) from any source.\\u2029 Suspected case\\u2029A person presenting a skin lesion with itching or blister living in an endemic area or risk areas for Guinea worm, with the emergence of a worm.\\u2029 Confirmed case\\u2029A case of guinea-worm disease is a person exhibiting a skin lesion with emergence of a Guinea worm, and in which the worm is confirmed in laboratory tests to be D. medinensis. That person is counted as a case only once during the calendar year, i.e. when the first worm emerges from that person. All worm specimens should be obtained from each case patient for laboratory confirmation and sent to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All cases should be monitored at least twice per month during the remainder of the calendar year for prompt detection of possible emergence of additional guinea worms. 267\\u2029267Respond to alert threshold: Dracunculiasis\\ufdd0As a disease targeted for eradication, every rumour or suspected case of Guinea worm disease is an emergency.\\u2029Follow up and investigate any rumour of dracunculiasis (within 24 hours of notification), using the national programme guidelines and WHO recommended forms, in order to determine whether or not there is a suspected case requiring further follow-up, monitoring and specimen collection for laboratory investigation.\\u2029If a single case is suspected:\\u2029Report the case according to national program guidelines for eradication of Dracunculiasis.\\u2029Treat the wound (if any) to decrease disability associated with painful leg lesions.\\u2029Collect and preserve specimen of any emerged worm in 70% alcohol, according to WHO /National guidelines for specimen handling, and send to WHO Country Office for onward transmission to WHO Collaborating Centre at CDC, for laboratory analysis\\u2029Conduct case investigation to confirm risk factors and assess the source and burden of infection.\\u2029Improve access to safe water according to national guidelines.\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time:Graph cases monthly.\\u2029Place:Plot distributions of localities (communities) from which cases have been reported.\\u2029Person: Count monthly cases and analyse age distribution. Use data to forecast interventions. Report monthly to   next levels.\\ufdd0 Laboratory confirmation\\ufdd0A clinical diagnosis is usually made when the blister has ruptured, and the anterior end of the female worm can be seen, and the worm emerges. Current programme standards require that the emerged worm is sent to the laboratory for confirmation as D. medinensis. Several other worms emerging from the skin may mimic Guinea worm disease, notably onchocerciasis and sparganosis, and should be differentiated from dracunculiasis through laboratory confirmation.  Collect and preserve any emerged specimen according to WHO/ National guidelines for specimen handling and send to WHO Country office for onward transmission to WHO Collaborating Centre at CDC for laboratory analysis (mandatory).

Ebola or Marburg virus diseases Background\\ufdd0The Ebola and Marburg viruses are both filoviruses.\\u2029Almost 3,000 cases of Ebola with over 1,900 deaths have been documented since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976. Major Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Sudan, DRC, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Uganda and Congo.\\u2029More than 500 cases of Marburg with over 400 deaths were reported during outbreaks of Marburg virus that occurred in DRC (1998-2000), Angola (2004-2005) and Uganda (3 cases in 2007).\\u2029These two viruses are transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons. The infection of humans with Ebola virus through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, and forest antelopes (alive and dead) has been documented.\\u2029Ecological studies are in progress to identify the natural reservoirs of both Marburg and Ebola. There is evidence that fruit bats are involved.\\u2029Epidemics can be dramatically amplified in health care facilities with inadequate infection control precautions/barrier nursing procedures.\\u2029Incubation period for Ebola and Marburg is 2 to 21 days.\\u2029Between 20% and 80% of patients have haemorrhagic manifestations depending on the Ebola or Marburg virus strain. Patients become increasingly infectious as their illness progresses.\\u2029High case fatality ratios have been reported during Ebola outbreaks (25% to 90%) and during Marburg outbreaks (25% to 80%)\\u2029There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes.\\u2029Close contact with a severely ill patient, during care at home or in hospital, and certain burial practices are common routes of infection.

Epilepsy Background\\ufdd0Epilepsy is defined as the recurrence of, at least, two epileptic seizures with sudden occurrence of abnormal signs which could be: motor, tonic, sensitive, sensorial, neuro-vegetative, or psycho-behavioural. These symptoms could or could not be associated to a loss of conscience. It can appear at any age.\\u2029Epilepsy is the most common result of brain cells disturbance that lead to excessive nerve-cell discharges. According to the disturbance on some or many groups of cells, seizures could be partial or generalized.\\u2029Seizures with tonic-clonic muscle movements are named convulsion or fit or attack. Convulsion can appear at any age; all convulsions are not systematically epilepsy.\\u2029Epilepsy is frequent in the Region and its prevalence rate range from 2.2 to 58 per 1000 persons. Studies from five sub-Saharan African countries showed an incidence ranging from 64 to 156 per 100,000 person/year.\\u2029This higher incidence may be a consequence of many risk factors which are related with predisposing factors such as poor perinatal care, head trauma, consanguinity.\\u2029Many etiological factors are related with communicable diseases (malaria, tuberculosis, meningitis, neurocysticerocisis and HIV), non-communicable diseases (high blood pressure, diabetes, alcoholism and illicit drug use), poorer medical facilities, poorer general health and a lower standard of living. Misunderstanding linked to cultural beliefs, sigma and exclusion do not facilitate appropriate care.\\u2029Epilepsy substantially increases mortality risk, particularly in conditions of later detection due to lack of well-trained health workers to diagnose and treat neurological disorders.\\u2029Death and injury occur primarily due to status epilepticus (especially in the case of abrupt medication withdrawal), burns and drowning.\\u2029\\u2029It has been estimated that in developing countries, up to 80% of people with epilepsy are not receiving treatment, or are often not even identified. While the etiological diagnosis of the epilepsies may be more difficult in developing countries, due to limited investigative resources, many can be diagnosed on the basis of simple clinical and epidemiological knowledge.\\ufdd0 Standard case definition: Epilepsy\\u2029\\ufdd0Suspected case: Any person with one epileptic seizure\\u2029Suspected new case: Report only the first diagnostic of the case in the health centre\\u2029Confirmed case:\\u2029Any person with recurrence of, at least, two epileptic seizures. A positive response to treatment with any antiepileptic (AED) strengthens the hypothesis of a confirmed case. Epileptic seizures can last for 30 seconds to 3 minutes. When they are intricate without a pause, they can lead to status epilepticus.\\ufdd0Respond to alert threshold\\ufdd0Suspected cases\\u2029All health personnel should check for early signs of epilepsy. Diagnosis should include good interviews (describing as precisely as possible the seizure type) and clinical examination.\\u2029Once diagnosed, search for underlying and associated causes. Check for abnormal increases on number of cases and propose appropriate environmental measures if needed.\\u2029Confirmed cases\\u2029Immediate treatment should be ensured starting with low doses of any anti-epileptic drug then increasing progressively until an effective steady state. In case of poor seizure control management strategies must be: increase the dose or try an alternative drug, refer to an upper level health structure.\\u2029Referral to higher level health structure should be done if seizures continue regardless of pharmacological treatment or if first seizure occurs in an adult aged 30 years and above.\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0All cases: Information and education measures on epilepsy and risk factors at community level\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Person: Analyse sex and age distribution (by age group from 6 years onwards) \\u2029Time: Graph quarterly cases\\u2029Place:Plot the distribution by area of residence Laboratory confirmation: Epilepsy\\ufdd0Diagnostic test\\ufdd0Blood glucose (random capillary blood, and venous blood sugar), electrolytes to exclude other conditions such as diabetes, kidney pathology\\u2029Exclude other conditions such as cerebral malaria, meningitis, toxoplasmosis; cerebral calcifications follow tuberculosis (tuberculoma), parasitic diseases and others by conducting appropriate medical investigations.\\ufdd0Specimen\\ufdd0Blood, and cerebro-spinal fluid\\ufdd0When to collect the specimen\\ufdd0Glucose – During the emergency admission of the patient (random blood glucose) Confirmed subsequently (fasting blood glucose)\\ufdd0How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen\\ufdd0Use universal precautions to minimize exposure to sharps and anybody fluid\\ufdd0Results\\ufdd0Results are always available within 1 to 3 hours from arrival in the laboratory\\ufdd0References :\\ufdd0WHO, Epilepsy in the WHO African Region: Bridging the Gap, WHO Regional Office for Africa, Congo, 2004.\\u2029WHO, Epilepsy: a manual for medical and clinical officers in Africa, WHO, Geneva 2002\\u2029 Foodborne Illnesses Background\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0Foodborne illnesses are caused by a variety of bacterial, viral, parasitic or fungal pathogens or their toxins that enter the body through consumption of food or water.

It is classified as either primary (essential) or secondary. ‘Primary’ hypertension is elevated blood pressure where no medical cause is found. ‘Secondary’ hypertension is caused by other conditions that affect the arteries, heart, endocrine system or kidneys.\\u2029Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke. According to The World Health Report 2001, cardiovascular disease related deaths are increasing in the African Region, and in 2000 accounted for 9.2% of the total deaths in the African Region. Prevalence ranges from 25% to 35% in adults aged 25 to 64 years.\\u2029Hypertension affects approximately 1 billion worldwide and it is estimated that more than 20 million people in the African Region are affected.\\u2029Major risk factors for hypertension are ageing, lack of physical activity, obesity, and a diet high in salt and fat. Other risk factors include; tobacco and alcohol use.\\u2029Lifestyle modifications shown to lower BP include; weight reduction for individuals who are overweight or obese, reducing the amount of fat and salt in the diet, and eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, increased physical activity, and reduction of alcohol and tobacco consumption.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Prevention of secondary illness by early detection and standardized treatment\\u2029Estimation of disease burden and reduction of identified risk factors\\u2029Monitor control and prevention activities\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected new case at first visit:\\u2029Any individual presenting with a resting blood pressure measurement (based on the average of 3 readings) at or above 140 mm Hg for systolic pressure, or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg for diastolic pressure.\\u2029Confirmed case:\\u2029Any individual presenting on at least two occasions with a resting blood pressure measurement (based on the average of 3 readings) at or above 140 mm Hg for systolic pressure, or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg for diastolic pressure.\\u2029* Report only the first diagnosis of the case in the health centre\\ufdd0Recommended public health action: Hypertension\\ufdd0Health promotion for non-communicable diseases focusing on HBP should be established, including community-based education on behaviour change and adoption of healthy lifestyles\\u2029Promote secondary prevention and treatment interventions at health facilities according to national guidelines.\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time: Graph cases quarterly to analyse trends.\\u2029Place: Compare district trends with national and regional trends.\\u2029Person: Analyse the distribution of cases by age and other demographic factors.\\u2029   *Data for non-communicable diseases is often analysed for long term trends\\ufdd0Laboratory confirmation\\ufdd0Diagnostic is clinical.\\ufdd0Reference\\ufdd0WHO, Atlas of heart disease and stroke, Geneva, World Health Organization, 2004.\\u2029Non communicable Diseases: A strategy for the African Region, AFR/RC50/10\\u2029Cardiovascular Diseases in the African Region: Current situation and perspectives, AFR/RC55/12\\u2029http://www.who.int/chp/steps/en/\\u2029http://www.afro.who.int/dnc/databases/afro infobase/index.html\\u2029WHO CVD-risk management package for low-and medium resource settings.\\u2029The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure U.S. Department of health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH Publication No. 03-5233, December 2003\\u2029Handbook of Hypertension, Vol 20.

Influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968; 2009. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 40–50 million people. It is predicted that a pandemic of equivalent magnitude could kill 62 million people, 96% of them in developing countries.\\u2029Influenza caused by new subtype were reported in i) 1997/human infections with the A(H5N1) virus HPAI; ii) 2009/Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic; iii) 2013/human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the A(H7N7) and A(H9N2) viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes.\\u2029\\u2029Successful mitigation or control of pandemic influenza is dependent on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new influenza A virus. Countries have been encouraged as part of pandemic preparedness planning to enhance surveillance to (i) detect the emergence of new disease; (ii) characterize the disease (epidemiology, clinical manifestations, severity); and (iii) monitor its evolution and start control measures.\\u2029Under the IHR (2005), a State Party is to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.\\ufdd0Surveillance goals\\ufdd0To detect and investigate the first evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus with pandemic potential.\\u2029To assess the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country in order to characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features.\\u2029To monitor the course of the pandemic within the country, regionally and globally.\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Standard case definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype\\u20291-For infections with other non-seasonal influenza viruses, case definitions must be adapted to the situation.

The energy causing the injury can be mechanical, electrical, thermal, radiant or chemical. Injury is classified as intentional and unintentional.\\u2029All injuries account for 10% of the world’s deaths. 5.8 million People die each year as a result of different types of injuries. Of the all systems that people have to deal with on a daily basis; road transport is the most complex and the most dangerous.\\u2029Road traffic accidents result in unintentional injury.\\u2029A traffic collision (motor vehicle collision, motor vehicle accident, car accident, or car crash) occurs when a road vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris, or other geographical or architectural obstacle. Traffic collisions can result in injury, property damage, and death.\\u2029Worldwide, the number of people killed in road traffic crashes each year is estimated at 1.2 million, while the number of injured could be as high as 50 million.\\u2029Road traffic injuries are a major but neglected global public health problem, requiring concerted efforts for effective and sustainable prevention.\\u2029Road traffic injuries continue to be among the leading causes of death and disability among young people aged between 5 and 44 years and the leading cause of death in the category of people between 15-29 years. The majority of such deaths are currently among “vulnerable road users”-pedestrians, pedal cyclists and motorcyclists.\\u2029Without increased efforts and new initiatives, the total number of road traffic deaths worldwide and injuries is forecast to rise by some 67% by 2020, and in low income and middle-income countries deaths are expected to increase by as much as 83%\\u2029The African region has the highest fatality rate for road traffic crashes at 32/100 000 population\\u2029Road traffic injuries are preventable.

Mauritania reports a few cases each year and South Africa reported 165 laboratory-confirmed cases between 1981 and March 2006.\\u2029Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. Some studies indicate that 300,000 to 500,000 Lassa fever cases with 5,000 deaths occur each year in West Africa.\\u2029CCHF spreads to humans either by tick-bites, or through contact with viraemic animal tissue immediately post-slaughter.\\u2029The animal reservoir of the Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus Mastomys. Mastomys infected with Lassa virus do not become ill but shed the virus in their excreta (urine and faeces) and humans usually become infected through aerosol or direct contact with excreta of infected rodents. Lassa fever can also be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, pharyngeal secretions, urine, faeces or other body secretions of an infected person.\\u2029Person-to-person transmission of both CCHF and Lassa fever viruses has occurred in health care settings after exposure to blood and secretions of infected patients.\\u2029The incubation period for CCHF following a tick bite is usually 1-3 days (maximum 9 days) and following contact with blood or tissues is usually 5-6 days (maximum 13 days). The incubation period for Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days.\\u2029The onset of symptoms among CCHF patients is sudden with fever, myalgia and other signs and symptoms. The reported case fatality ratio for CCHF is between 3% and 30%.\\u2029About 80% of human Lassa fever infections are mild or asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease. The onset of disease in symptomatic patients is usually gradual starting with fever, general weakness and malaise. Lassa fever is difficult to distinguish from many other diseases which cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, yellow fever and other VHFs. The overall case fatality ratio ranges from 1 to 15% among hospitalized patients.\\u2029General supportive therapy is the mainstay of patient management in CCHF. Intensive monitoring to guide volume and blood component replacement is required. The antiviral drug, ribavirin, has been used in the treatment of established CCHF infection. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective. Ribavirin is effective treatment for Lassa fever is given early in the course of clinical illness.\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Surveillance goal : Lassa and Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fevers\\ufdd0Early detection of cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the aetiology of all suspected cases.\\u2029Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing.\\u2029Assess and monitor the spread and progress of epidemics and the effectiveness of control measures.\\ufdd0Standard case definitions\\ufdd0Suspected case of CCHF: Illness with sudden onset of fever, malaise, weakness, irritability, headache, severe pain in limbs and loins and marked anorexia.

The disease is transmitted mainly through airborne spread from nasal secretions of patients infected by Hansen’s bacillus (Mycobacterium leprae) and also through inoculation into broken skin. Leprosy is endemic in several tropical areas around the world, including Africa.\\u2029Patients are classified into two groups, depending on presence of skin and nerve signs:\\u2029Multibacillary patients (MB) with more than 5 skin patches and several nerve enlargements.\\u2029Paucibacillary patients (PB) with one to five skin patches and a single nerve enlargement.\\u2029Leprosy control has improved greatly through use of WHO recommended multidrug therapy (MDT). MDT combining two or three drugs (rifampicin, clofaximine and dapsone) is very effective in curing leprosy. At the end of 1999, leprosy point prevalence in African countries was 1.6 cases per 10 000 population with about 70 000 registered cases. Seventeen years later, at the end of 2016, this prevalnec rate was reduced to 0.25 cases per 10 000 population and les than 25 000 registered cases \\u2029Incubation period is 6 months to 20 years or more. Infection is probably frequent but clinical disease is rare, even among the closest contacts of patients. Multibacillary patients are most contagious, but infectiousness is reduced rapidly as soon as multiple drug therapy begins.

It affects over 120 million persons in 80 countries, and over 40 million persons are seriously incapacitated by the disease; 20% of the world population is at risk of infection. Of those infected, roughly 1/3 are in India, 1/3 in Africa, and the rest in the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific. In 1997, resolution WHA50.29 called for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a global public health problem. The strategy adopted is based on:\\u2029Reducing transmission below a threshold where new infection ceases to occur\\u2029Treatment of the problems associated with disability control and prevention.\\u2029Causal agents:in Africa only the filariae Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori\\u2029Modes of transmission: transmitted by various species of mosquitoes, these parasitic filarial worms lodge in the human lymphatic system, producing millions of immature microfilariae that circulate in the blood. Microfilariae appear in the peripheral blood after 3 to 6 months for Brugia malayi, 6 to 12 months for W bancrofti, often with nocturnal periodicity. When a mosquito thereafter bites the infected person, the microfilariae are picked up and the infection may be transmitted to others after about 2 weeks.\\u2029Clinical description:\\u2029Filarial infection may be clinically asymptomatic (even in the presence of laboratory evidence of lymphatic and kidney damage); the disease may also present as one or more acute manifestations (fever, local swellings, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome, lymphangitis).\\u2029Chronic complications include:\\u2029Lymphoedema or elephantiasis of the limbs\\u2029Damage to the genital organs (including hydrocoele in men)\\u2029Damage to the kidney (including chyluria) and lymphatic system.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0There are currently 3 options and the choice will depend on the local situation:\\u2029Routine monthly reporting of aggregated data on probable and confirmed cases from periphery to intermediate level and to central level\\u2029Sentinel population surveys (standardized and periodical),\\u2029Active case-finding through surveys of selected groups or through mass surveys.

To interrupt transmission, the entire at risk population must be given a yearly, 1-dose regimen of the following:\\u2029Areas with concurrent onchocerciasis:\\u2029400 mg of albendazole + ivermectin 150 mg per kg of body weight once a year for 4-6 years\\u2029Areas with no concurrent Onchocerciasis\\u2029Diethylcarbamazine 6 milligrams per kg of body weight + albendazole 400 mg once a year, or\\u2029Diethylcarbamazine fortified salt for daily use for at least 6-12 months.\\u2029NOTE: In areas with concurrent loiasis (sub-Saharan Africa rain forest), mass interventions cannot at present be envisaged systematically (unless Onchocerciasis is a severe public health problem), because of the risk of severe adverse reactions in patients with high-density Loa infections (about 1 in 10,000 treatments).\\u2029It is important to educate the population on the importance of compliance during mass chemotherapy.

Five parasite species cause malaria in humans, namely: Plasmodium falciparum (the most common), P. ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. knowlesi. Serious malarial infections are usually due to P. falciparum which may result in severe disease.\\u2029\\u2029Malaria is one of the leading causes of illness and death in many African countries. In most parts of Africa malaria transmission is highly seasonal. In areas of high transmission in Africa malaria is mainly a disease of children less than 5 years old and pregnant women. However, some countries have witnessed a dramatic reduction of malaria transmission and in such countries malaria has become a disease of all age groups and malaria epidemics are likely to occur.\\u2029\\u2029The incubation period from the time of being bitten to onset of symptoms is approximately 10 to 14 days. The incubation period may be longer, with non- P. falciparum species. \\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Detect malaria cases promptly in areas of high transmission and to detect epidemics promptly in epidemic prone areas or in areas with a large population at risk.\\ufdd0Standard case definition: Malaria\\ufdd0Uncomplicated malaria: Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria is highly variable and mimics that of many other diseases. Although fever is common, it is often intermittent and may even be absent in some cases. The fever is typically irregular initially and commonly associated with chills. Rigors are unusual in acute falciparum malaria. The patient commonly complains of fever, headache, aches and pains elsewhere in the body and occasionally abdominal pain and diarrhoea. In a young child, there may be irritability, refusal to eat and vomiting. On physical examination, fever may be the only sign. In some patients, the liver and spleen are palpable. This clinical presentation is usually indistinguishable clinically from those of influenza and a variety of other common causes of fever. Unless the condition is diagnosed and treated promptly, a patient with falciparum malaria may deteriorate rapidly. Therefore, any person living in an area at risk of malaria with fever or history of fever within the previous 24 hours; without signs of severe malaria, who tests positive for malaria by either rapid diagnostic test or microscopy should be considered a case of uncomplicated malaria (NB WHO presently recommends that all malaria cases should be confirmed by RDT or microscopy).\\u2029\\u2029Severe malaria: Severe malaria is defined by clinical or laboratory evidence of vital organ dysfunction. Nearly all deaths from severe malaria result from infections with P. falciparum. Strict definitions of severe malaria have been published for epidemiological and research purposes, but, in practice, there should be a low threshold for starting parenteral treatment in any patient about whom a health care worker is concerned. Even if some of the laboratory measures are not available immediately, this should not delay the start of intensive treatment. A general overview of the features of severe malaria include: \\u2029impaired consciousness (including unarousable coma);\\u2029prostration, i.e. generalized weakness so that the patient is unable to sit, stand or walk without assistance;\\u2029multiple convulsions: more than two episodes within 24h;\\u2029deep breathing and respiratory distress (acidotic breathing);\\u2029acute pulmonary oedema and acute respiratory distress syndrome;\\u2029circulatory collapse or shock, systolic blood pressure\\u2029< 80mm Hg in adults and < 50mm Hg in children;\\u2029acute kidney injury;\\u2029 clinical jaundice plus evidence of other vital organ dysfunction; and abnormal bleeding\\u2029Note: These manifestations can occur singly or, more commonly, in combination in the same patient.\\u2029\\u2029Any patient hospitalized with P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia as confirmed by laboratory tests with accompanying symptoms and signs of severe disease (vital organ dysfunction) diagnosed through laboratory.\\ufdd0Respond to alert threshold: Malaria\\ufdd0If there is an unusual increase in the number of malaria cases or deaths as compared to the same period in previous non-epidemic years:\\u2029Report suspected epidemic to the next level,\\u2029Treat with appropriate anti-malarial drugs according to national treatment guidelines\\u2029Investigate the cause for the increase in cases\\u2029Make sure cases in children age 2 months up to 5 years are managed according to IMCI guidelines.\\u2029Conduct community education for prompt detection of cases and access to health facilities.\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0If the number of cases exceeds the upper limit of cases seen in a previous non-epidemic period in previous years:\\u2029Evaluate and improve, as needed, prevention strategies, such as use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residential spraying (IRS) for all at risk of malaria.\\u2029Ensure appropriate case management\\u2029Ensure adequate supplies and drugs are available in the health facilities\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time: Graph the number of cases by month/week.

Geneva. World Health Organization. WHO/MAL/98.1084\\u2029Basic Laboratory Methods in Medical Parasitology, WHO, Geneva, 1991 Malaria Continued... Note: Setting an epidemic threshold: In areas with endemic malaria, the national Malaria Control Program can assist districts and health centres with determining appropriate thresholds for detecting possible epidemics. In the absence of a threshold set by the national program, the following method can be used to determine the threshold level for a malaria epidemic. The threshold is determined using the median and the 3rd quartile of a period of time (for example, 5-year data from a health facility or district by month/week): Look at the number of malaria cases at a specific health facility or district by month/week for the past 5 years. Determine the median for each month/week (for example, each January for the last 5 years). Rank the monthly/weekly data for each month/week for the five years in ascending order. Identify the number in the middle of each month’s/week’s series for the five years. This is the median. Repeat this process for each month/week in the five years. Determine the 3rd quartile for the monthly/weekly series by identifying the 4th highest number from the bottom in each data series (since data is ranked in ascending order). This is the 3rd quartile representing the upper limit of the expected normal number of malaria cases. Plot the 3rd Quartile for each data series by month/week for the five year period and join the points with a line. The line represents the upper limit of the expected number of cases. Plot the median for each data series by month/week for the five year period and join the points with a line. This line represents the lowest limit of expected number of cases. The area between the two lines (the median and the 3rd quartile) represents the “normal channel”. If the number of currently observed cases of malaria falls between the two lines, the number of new cases for that month/week is assumed to be “normal”. If the number is above the 3rd quartile (upper limit), this is an indication of a possible malaria epidemic. Note: Please note that to ensure early detection and control of malaria epidemics; it is preferable to use weekly surveillance data in Malaria epidemic prone areas. In areas in malaria pre-elimination or elimination phases a single case of locally transmitted malaria should lead to proactive interventions, including active case search in the locality where the case originated. Source: WHO/AFRO Regional Malaria Program Malnutrition Background\\ufdd0Globally, maternal and child under-nutrition are underlying causes for 3·5 million deaths, including 35% of the disease burden in children younger than 5 years. Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.\\u2029Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.\\u2029Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.\\u2029The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.\\u2029Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.\\u2029Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.\\u2029Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Early warning and problem identification.\\u2029Policy-making and planning.\\u2029Programme management and evaluation.\\u2029Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women Standard case definition: Malnutrition\\ufdd0Low birth weight new-borns:\\u2029Any new born with a birth weight less than 2500 g (or 5.5 lbs) \\u2029Malnutrition in children:\\u2029-Children under five who are underweight (indicator: weight for age<-2 ZScore)\\u2029-Children 6 to 59 months with mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) <11.5 cm (high risk of \\u2029mortality)\\u2029-Bilateral pitting oedema\\u2029Malnutrition in pregnant women:\\u2029Pregnant women given birth to low birth weight babies (birth weight < 2.5 Kg) (poor nutritional and health status of the women, can predict which population groups may benefit from improved antenatal care of women and neonatal care for infants).\\ufdd0Response to alert threshold\\ufdd0If more than 20% of children are underweight: Programme emphasis on\\u2029Breastfeeding support\\u2029Nutrition education\\u2029Supplementation of child and mother\\u2029Prevention and treatment of diarrhoea\\u2029Prevention and treatment of severe malnutrition\\u2029Socio-economic support\\u2029As soon as one case with MUAC less than 11.5 cm is detected or presence of bilateral oedema identified: Alert, further investigation should be conducted.

(NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)\\u2029Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.\\u2029\\u2029Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.\\u2029Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live births\\u2029Review of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Some laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection are reported as asymptomatic, meaning that they do not have any clinical symptoms, yet they are positive for MERS following a laboratory test. Most of these asymptomatic cases have been detected following aggressive contact tracing of a laboratory-confirmed case.\\u2029Approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS have died.\\u2029Dromedary camels are the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and humans are infected from direct or indirect unprotected contact with infected dromedary camels. However, the exact role of dromedaries in transmission of the virus and the exact route(s) of transmission are unknown.\\u2029The virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close unprotected contact, such as occurs when providing care to a patient. Health care associated outbreaks have occurred in several countries, with the largest outbreaks seen in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Korea. \\u2029Approximately half of human cases of MERS have been attributed to human-to-human infections in health care settings.\\u2029\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Surveillance Goal\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0To detect early cases of MERS-CoV infection and any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission\\u2029To determine the geographic risk areas for infection with the virus\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-surveillance/en/\\u2029The following people should be investigated and tested for MERS-CoV (From: Surveillance for human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -

The presence of viral nucleic acid can be confirmed by either positive results for nucleic acid amplification assays, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), for at least two specific genomic targets or a single positive target with sequencing of a second target. A case confirmed by serology requires demonstration of sero-conversion in 2 samples ideally taken at least 14 days apart, by a screening (ELISA, IFA) and a neutralization assay. However, the interim recommendations for laboratory testing for MERS-CoV should be consulted for the most recent standard for laboratory confirmation (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/)\\u20292 A direct epidemiological link with a confirmed MERS-CoV patient may include:\\u2029Health care associated exposure, including providing direct care for MERS-CoV patients, working with health care workers infected with MERS-CoV, visiting patients or staying in the same close environment of a individuals infected with MERS-CoV. \\u2029Working together in close proximity or sharing the same environment with individuals infected with MERS-CoV. \\u2029Traveling together with individuals infected with MERS-CoV in any kind of conveyance \\u2029Living in the same household as individuals infected with MERS-CoV. \\u2029The epidemiological link may have occurred within a 14-day period before or after the onset of illness in the case under consideration. \\u20293 An inadequate specimen would include a nasopharyngeal swab without an accompanying lower respiratory specimen, a specimen that has had improper handling, is judged to be of poor quality by the testing laboratory, or was taken too late in the course of illness.\\u20294 Inconclusive tests may include: \\u2029A positive test by nucleic acid amplification assay for a single target without further  testing.\\u2029Evidence of sero-reactivity by a single convalescent serum sample ideally taken at least 14 days after exposure by a screening assay (ELISA or IFA) and a neutralization assay, in the absence of molecular confirmation from respiratory specimens. \\u2029Inconclusive testing: Patients with an inconclusive initial testing should undergo additional virologic and serologic testing to determine if the patient can be classified as a confirmed MERS case. It is strongly advised that multiple lower respiratory tract specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid be collected and tested when possible. If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and lower tract specimens are not available or clinically indicated, both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens should be collected. If initial testing of a nasopharyngeal swab is negative in a patient who is strongly suspected to have MERS-CoV infection, patients should be retested using a lower respiratory specimen tract or a repeat nasopharyngeal specimen with additional oropharyngeal specimen if lower respiratory tract specimens are not possible, and appropriately timed paired acute and convalescent sera. Other types of clinical specimens could also be considered for molecular testing if necessary, including blood/serum, urine and stool. These generally have lower titres of virus than respiratory tract specimens but have been used to confirm cases when other specimens were inadequate or unobtainable. Laboratories which obtain discordant PCR testing results and have limited experience in detecting MERS-CoV should consider referring their specimens to laboratories with greater experience for confirmation.\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Refer to the WHO case reporting form (available in English and French)\\u2029Responding to an alert \\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0If a single case/cluster or outbreak is suspected:\\u2029All health care workers who collect specimens from patients suspected or confirmed with MERS-CoV must wear appropriate personal protective equipment, and\\u2029Standard and droplet infection control precautions are sufficient when collecting biological samples from suspected patients.\\u2029Additional precautions are required when aerosol-generating procedures are performed on a patient\\u2029All those involved in collection and transporting specimens should be trained in safe handling practices and spill decontamination procedures.\\u2029WHO requests that probable and confirmed cases be reported within 24 hours of classification, through the regional contact point for International Health Regulations at the appropriate WHO regional office. \\u2029\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Proper and respectful burial or cremation (if practiced) of dead bodies (humans)\\u2029Conduct community education about the confirmed case, how the disease is transmitted, and how to use infection control in the home care setting (see http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-infection/en/)\\u2029Efforts to identify additional cases beyond close contacts are critical for prevention and control of infection, and to determine the total extent of transmission in the community.

If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and the collection of lower tract specimens is not possible or clinically indicated, upper respiratory tract specimens such as a nasopharyngeal aspirate or combined nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs should be collected. \\u2029If initial testing is negative in a patient who is strongly suspected to have MERS-CoV infection, the patient should be resampled and specimens collected from multiple respiratory tract sites. Paired acute and convalescent sera for antibody detection should also be collected.

It is usually a self-limiting disease but the case-fatality rate can be up to 10%, particularly among children.\\u2029Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West and Central Africa. The primary animal reservoir is unknown but it has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. Animal species in which evidence of monkeypox virus has been found include C. gambianus (Gambian pouched rat), different squirrel species of the genus Funisciurus and Heliosciurus, G. kelleni (African dormice) and various species of non-human primates. \\u2029Communities living in the West and Central African rainforest regions need to be educated about avoiding direct contact with animals, especially wild species. Efforts to prevent transmission in endemic regions should focus on thoroughly cooking all animal products (blood, meat) before eating.\\u2029Human-to-human transmission is limited (no evidence that this mode of transmission alone can sustain monkeypox in human populations) and occurs via prolonged contact with respiratory droplets and contact with lesions or bodily fluids that contain the virus. Household members and health care workers are at highest risk during an outbreak.\\u2029Monkeypox is an emerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since the global eradication of smallpox that was declared by the World Health Assembly in 1980. This is partly because smallpox vaccination which was cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses was discontinued at the time which means younger people no longer have vaccine-induced immunity.\\u2029Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo which remains the country that routinely reports the highest number of cases (>1,000) annually since 2005. Other countries that have reported human cases since 1970 include Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan (in an area that is now South Sudan). Since late 2016 there have been increasing reports of monkeypox cases from countries that have not seen any for the past 40 years.\\u2029Clinical recognition, particularly differential diagnosis with other rash and fever illnesses such as chickenpox, laboratory-based diagnosis and prevention remain critical challenges in endemic areas. Two distinct clades or subtypes have been identified. It is believed that infection with a West African strain of monkeypox virus causes a less severe infection, fewer deaths, and lower rates of human-to-human transmission as compared to outbreaks involving Central African strains.\\u2029The incubation period of monkeypox is 6-16 days (range 5–21). The infection can be divided into two periods: (1) invasion period (0-5 days) characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph node), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache) and an intense asthenia (lack of energy); and (2) skin eruption period (1-3 days after appearance of fever) where the various stages of the rash appears, often beginning on the face and then spreading elsewhere on the body.\\u2029The most distinguishing symptom of monkeypox is lymphadenopathy. The face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (75%) are most affected by the rash. Evolution of the rash from maculo-papules (lesions with a flat bases) to vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), pustules, followed by crusts occurs in approximately 10 days. Three weeks might be necessary before the complete disappearance of the crusts. \\u2029Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with monkeypox but can be distinguished from monkeypox and smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Coinfection with both, varicella and monkeypox virus, has been reported. However the frequency of this phenomenon, relationship and impact between the viruses’ pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0To detect and immediately respond to any suspected case of monkeypox.\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 C (101 F), intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of hand.\\u2029Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case.\\u2029Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed.\\u2029Differential diagnosis: Alternative causes of clinical symptoms that must be considered include other rash illnesses, such as, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies.

It is caused by a retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Sexual intercourse, needle injections, transfusions, trans-placental or trans-vaginal routes, breast milk or other direct contact with infected human body fluids transmits the virus from human to human.\\u2029Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) results in late-stage HIV infection and immuno-suppression, with reduced numbers and function to T-lymphocytes. Primary HIV-related organ involvement and a variety of opportunistic infections result in death unless the growth of the virus is stopped by drugs that can kill the virus (antiretroviral therapy). When HIV infection progresses to illness, the symptoms are usually due to the failure of the immune system to resist other infectious diseases called opportunistic infections (OI). These include tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia or sepsis, oro-pharyngeal candidiasis, chronic diarrhoea, chronic skin infections, recurrent herpes zoster, and others.\\u2029Close to twenty-six million Africans, close to one in ten adults between the ages of 15 and 49 years of age, are living with HIV/AIDS. The impact of the epidemic is already measurable in greatly increased adult and child morbidity and mortality. HIV/AIDS is now the leading cause of adult mortality in the African Region.\\u2029Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months from the time of infection to the time that antibodies can be detected in a laboratory process. The time from HIV infection to the onset of AIDS is generally 7 to 9 years.\\u2029Risk factors: populations at high risk of acquiring HIV are commercial sex workers with or without other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Some STIs may increase HIV transmission. Others at risk include intravenous drug users (IDU), recipients of unscreened blood products and neonates born to HIV-infected mothers.\\u2029Tuberculosis, visceral leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and other subacute or chronic bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Monitor the impact of HIV/AIDS interventions in trends of incidence and prevalence of HIV infections, AIDS and STIs through sentinel sites, surveys and special studies (according to guidelines for second generation surveillance of HIV/AIDS).\\u2029Estimate the burden of HIV/AIDS in the district using available information from HIV sentinel populations so that each new AIDS case is counted.\\u2029Monitor local STI epidemiology as possible cofactor for HIV transmission.\\u2029Monitor local opportunistic infection epidemiology, including TB\\u2029Improve percentage of suspected HIV/AIDS cases confirmed via serology.\\u2029Improve HIV/AIDS screening.\\ufdd0Standard case definition: New HIV/AIDS Cases\\ufdd0WHO/AFRO recommends that countries use either Bangui or Abidjan HIV/AIDS case definitions.

Diseases that commonly precede noma include measles, malaria, severe diarrhea, and necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.\\u2029Noma occurs worldwide, but is most common in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1998, WHO estimated that worldwide 140 000 children contract noma each year, and 79% of them die from the disease and associated complications.\\u2029In Africa the highest prevalence of Noma occurs in countries bordering the Sahara desert, where a recent report estimates an annual incidence of 25,000. However, Noma can occur wherever there is extreme poverty.\\u2029Early detection and treatment with antibiotics is key to preventing severe disfigurement or death. In the acute stage, death can be prevented with high doses of penicillin; however disfigurement can only be treated with costly surgery.\\u2029Prevention should focus on education and awareness of the disease, improved nutrition and household hygiene, promotion of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 3–6 months of life, access to prenatal care, and immunizations against common childhood diseases.\\u2029Clinical features include soreness of the mouth, pronounced halitosis (bad smelling breath), fetid taste, tenderness of the lip or cheek, cervical lymphadenopathy, a foul-smelling purulent oral discharge, and a blue-black discoloration of the skin and swelling in the affected area.\\u2029Health workers should recognize risk factors for Noma:\\u2029Severe growth failure in first 6 months of life\\u2029Evidence of malnutrition and poor dietary habits;\\u2029Persistent diarrhea\\u2029Oral ulcers in children from high risk areas\\u2029Prominent bad smelling breath\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Early detection and treatment of cases\\u2029Identification of high risk communities and families\\u2029Estimation of disease incidence and identification of risk factors\\ufdd0Standard case definition: Noma\\ufdd0Suspected new case:\\u2029Any child with a mouth ulcer and other warning signs such as; malnutrition, poor hygiene, recent illness from; measles, persistent diarrhoea, or malaria should be regarded as a potential noma case.\\u2029Confirmed new case:\\u2029Any person with a gangrenous disease which starts as gingival ulceration and spreads rapidly through the tissues of the mouth and face, destroying the soft and hard tissues.\\ufdd0Recommended public health action: Noma\\ufdd0When a suspected case is detected:\\u2029Treat the case with nationally recommended antibiotic\\u2029Conduct health promotion activities in the community for:\\u2029Awareness of Noma among the community and in the household\\u2029Improved environmental sanitation and personal hygiene\\u2029Separation of livestock from areas where humans live\\u2029Exclusive breast feeding for the first 6 months of life\\u2029Improved nutrition and food preparation techniques\\u2029Increase vaccination coverage in the district\\u2029Improve sources of drinking water in at-risk communities\\u2029Train public health personnel on early recognition of oral lesions that can lead to Noma.\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time:Monitor number of cases detected in time for treatment and use of standardized treatment.

This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  \\u2029\\u2029Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths. \\u2029 \\u2029The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. \\u2029\\u2029One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: \\u2029Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;\\u2029Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths \\u2029 Standard case definitions: Perinatal (Stillbirths and Neonatal) Deaths\\ufdd0Perinatal death includes the death of a baby of at least 28 weeks of gestation and/or 1,000 g in weight and early neonatal death (the first seven days after birth)\\u2029\\u2029A stillbirth is defined as any death of a baby before birth and with no signs of life at birth of at least 1,000 g birthweight and/or at least 28 weeks gestation and 35 cm long.\\u2029 \\u2029Early neonatal death is defined as any death of a live newborn occurring before the first 7 complete days of life.

WHO/EPI 2007 Rabies (Human) Background\\ufdd0Rabies is a zoonotic disease (a disease that is transmitted to humans from animals) that is caused by a virus. Rabies infects domestic and wild animals, and is spread to people through close contact with infected saliva (via bites or scratches).\\u2029The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing disease in the brain and, eventually, death. Early symptoms in people include: fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. As the disease\\u2029progresses,symptomsinclude;insomnia,anxiety,confusion,slightorpartialparalysis,excitable behaviour, hallucinations, increase in saliva, difficulty swallowing, and fear of water.\\u2029In unvaccinated humans, rabies is almost always fatal if post-exposure prophylaxis is not administered before the onset of severe symptoms. Death usually occurs within days of the onset of neurological symptoms.\\u2029Dogs are the main carrier of rabies in Africa and are responsible for most (approximately 97%) of the human rabies deaths worldwide.\\u2029WHO estimates approximately 55,000 human deaths worldwide due to rabies each year; in Africa the annual death toll is 24,000.\\u2029People most at risk of rabies live in rural areas, and children are at highest risk of dog rabies. About 30% to 60% of the victims of dog bites (the primary mode of virus transmission) are children less than 15 years of age. Children often play with animals and are less likely to report bites or scratches.\\u2029Control of rabies in dog populations and access to human rabies post exposure prophylaxis can substantially reduce the burden of rabies in human populations\\u2029Rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis of rabies in humans and other animals is essential for timely administration of post-exposure prophylaxis. Within a few hours, a diagnostic laboratory can determine whether or not an animal is rabid and inform the responsible medical personnel.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Detect and respond promptly and appropriately to cases and outbreaks of rabies.\\u2029Identify high-risk areas\\u2029Estimation of disease burden\\u2029Immediate reporting of cases and routine monthly summary reports\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected\\u2029A person with one or more of the following: headache, neck pain, nausea, fever, fear of water, anxiety, agitation, abnormal tingling sensations or pain at the wound site, when contact with a rabid animal is suspected.\\u2029Confirmed\\u2029A suspected case that is laboratory confirmed\\ufdd0Recommended Public Health Action: Rabies (Human)\\ufdd0For a single case:\\u2029Post exposure prophylaxis to prevent rabies\\u2029Isolate patient if rabies develops to prevent infection of others\\u2029Immunize contacts if patient develops rabies\\u2029Vaccinate local dogs and cats to prevent outbreaks\\u2029General preventive measures:\\u2029Promote public awareness of rabies\\u2029Target immunization campaign for domestic or wild animals in high-risk areas\\u2029Maintain active surveillance of rabies in animals\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time:Plot cases monthly.\\u2029Place:Plot the location of case households and animal exposures.\\u2029Person:Analyse distribution of cases by age, exposing animal, and circumstances of infection.

No test can determine whether the rabies virus has been transmitted to the person immediately after the bite. So, the animal is evaluated to determine whether the person requires treatment. A wild animal that has bitten a person is killed if possible, so that its brain can be examined.\\u2029If a person who has been bitten by an animal becomes increasingly confused and agitated or paralyzed, the diagnosis is probably rabies. At this point, tests can detect the rabies virus.\\u2029Post mortem: within 4-6hrs after death of patient, as soon as the suspected animal dies or is killed\\ufdd0How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen\\ufdd0Safety precautions in handling rabies virus should be taken to avoid infection.\\u2029Remove the head of the suspected animal, wrap head completely such that no blood is oozing out.

Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases, 6th edition. Philadelphia: Churchill Livingstone; 2005 Rift Valley Fever (RVF) Background\\ufdd0Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral disease that affects mainly animals and occasionally humans. The virus is a member of the Phlebovirus genus, one of the five genera in the family Bunyaviridae. The disease is frequently reported following heavy rainfall and floods. It was first isolated in Rift Valley Province of Kenya in 1930. The disease was reported in Kenya after the El Nino flooding of 1997/98 and more recently in 2006 to 2007. In 2007 and 2010, Tanzania and South Africa respectively were also affected. Other outbreaks have previously been reported in Somalia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\\u2029RVF is mainly transmitted from animals (sheep, cattle, goats, camels) to humans through close contact with infected animals (such as handling meat and body fluids and consumption of raw milk). During established RVF outbreaks in animals, humans can also get infected through bites of infected mosquitoes and other biting insects.\\u2029The incubation period of RVF varies from 2 to 6 days. The clinical symptoms include an influenza-like illness, with sudden onset of fever, headache, myalgia and backache. These symptoms usually last from 4 to 7 days. Most of the infected people recover on their own. However, a small proportion (about 1%) get complications such as vomiting blood, nose bleeding and passing bloody stool. Other severe types of the disease are eye disease and meningo-encephalitis. Because the symptoms of Rift Valley fever are varied and non-specific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult, especially early in the course of the disease. Rift Valley fever is difficult to distinguish from other viral haemorrhagic fevers as well as many other diseases that cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, and yellow fever. \\u2029Management of RVF in humans is mainly supportive as there is no definitive treatment for RVF. Early detection and management of the disease is important. Human control of RVF is through control of the disease in animals through a sustained vaccination program and limiting human-animal contact. Use of insecticide treated nets and mosquito repellents can also reduce infections in human. In addition to human suffering and death, RVF has far reaching economic implications to the Livestock industry. In outbreak settings, the disease manifestation includes non-haemorrhagic febrile syndromes, and laboratory testing should be considered among persons with milder symptoms suggestive of viral illness.\\u2029Immediate Notification to WHO is formally required by IHR (Annex 2A) Standard case definition: Rift Valley Fever (RVF)\\ufdd0Suspected case: \\u2029A.

It is estimated, as of December 2017, that annually 290 000 to 650 000 deaths are associated with seasonal influenza. The mortality rates are particularly high among vulnerable population such as children, elderly, chronically ill patients etc.\\u2029An improved understanding of the epidemiology and seasonality of SARIs in Africa is essential for optimizing public health strategies for their prevention and control (e.g., vaccines and antivirals for prophylaxis and treatment, infection control).\\u2029The threat of SARIs due to novel organisms that have epidemic or pandemic potential warrants special precautions and preparedness. Respiratory disease events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern1 include human influenza caused by a new subtype, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), pneumonic plague, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and novel agents that can cause large-scale SARI outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality.\\ufdd0Surveillance goals\\ufdd0To detect, in a timely manner, unusually severe morbidity and mortality caused by both known and unknown respiratory pathogens that have the potential for large-scale epidemics or pandemics.\\u2029To characterize and monitor trends in illnesses and deaths attributable to SARIs.\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0An acute respiratory infection with:\\u2029history of fever or measured fever of ≥ 38 C°;\\u2029and cough;\\u2029with onset within the last 10 days;\\u2029and requires hospitalization.\\ufdd0Respond to an alert threshold\\ufdd0Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if there is an unusual event (clusters of acute respiratory infections or of atypical respiratory infections, a cluster of deaths, for example) of respiratory infection. \\ufdd0Respond to an action threshold\\ufdd0Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if a single case of pandemic-prone acute respiratory disease is suspected.\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time: Frequency of reporting: Epidemiological and virological data collected from the sentinel sites should be analysed on a weekly basis. Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve throughout the year and describe transmission patterns and changes in the level of respiratory activity compared to the previous week(s), year(s) \\u2029Place: Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility.

UNAIDS/99.33E Smallpox (Variola) NOTE: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980 and there has been no disease in humans since 1977. Information in this section is provided to educate public health professionals to enable detection of re-emergence and to differentiate smallpox from similar diseases.\\ufdd0Background\\ufdd0Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by Variola virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, Poxviridae family. Other members of the genus that can cause disease in humans include Cowpox virus, Camelpox virus, and Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus has caused the most recent human poxvirus infections.\\u2029Smallpox killed up to 30% of those infected and left survivors scarred and sometimes blind. In 1967, when WHO launched an intensified programme to eradicate smallpox, annually there were 10-15 million cases and 2 million deaths globally.\\u2029The global eradication of smallpox was certified by a commission of eminent scientists in December 1979 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 1980.\\u2029The incubation period of smallpox is 12–14 days (range 7–17) during which there is no evidence of viral shedding i.e. the person is not infectious. During this period, the person looks and feels healthy and cannot infect others.\\u2029The disease presents as sudden onset of high fever and other symptoms such as malaise, headache, backache, nausea, vomiting. Two to three days later, the temperature falls and the patient feels somewhat better, at which time the characteristic rash appears, first on the face, hands and forearms and then after a few days progressing to the trunk. Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and ulcerate very soon after their formation, releasing large amounts of virus into the mouth and throat. The centrifugal distribution of lesions, more prominent on the face and extremities than on the trunk, is a distinctive diagnostic feature of smallpox and gives the trained eye cause to suspect the disease. Lesions progress from macules to papules to vesicles to pustules. All lesions in a given area progress together through these stages. From 8 to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, the pustules form scabs which leave depressed depigmented scars upon healing.\\u2029Smallpox had two main forms: variola major and variola minor (the latter was less common). The disease followed a milder course in variola minor, which had a case-fatality rate of less than 1 per cent. The fatality rate of variola major was around 30%. There are two rare forms of severe smallpox: haemorrhagic and malignant. In the former, invariably fatal, the rash was accompanied by haemorrhage into the mucous membranes and the skin. Malignant smallpox was characterized by lesions that did not develop to the pustular stage but remained soft and flat. It was almost invariably fatal.\\u2029Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with smallpox and can be distinguished from smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication.\\u2029Prior to the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox virus infections were first reported in human populations in 1970 and may have been misdiagnosed as smallpox due to the similarity of cutaneous presentation and progression. The clinical features of smallpox and human monkeypox are similar; however, smallpox patients do not develop lymphadenopathy which is a prominent clinical sign of monkeypox.  The disease progression through the incubation period, pre-eruptive stage and rash are also similar between the two diseases. Human monkeypox is milder with a lower case fatality ratio (up to 10 %) compared to smallpox (up to 30 %).\\u2029Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by infected aerosols and air droplets spread in direct and fairly prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person after fever has begun, especially if symptoms include coughing. The disease can also be transmitted by contaminated clothes and bedding, though the risk of infection from this source is much lower.\\u2029The most infectious period is when face-to-face contact occurs with a patient after fever has begun and during the first week of rash, when the virus is released via the respiratory tract. The most at-risk settings are households and health care settings with active cases but spread in the community is low because sick people are bedridden.\\u2029In the absence of immunity induced by vaccination, humans appear to be universally susceptible to infection with the smallpox virus. Since vaccination with smallpox vaccine was discontinued globally after the eradication of smallpox in 1980, most of the world’s population under 40 years of age are not immune and the older age groups have waning immunity.\\u2029WHO maintains smallpox vaccine emergency stockpiles to be deployed in the event of a smallpox re-emergence in order to contain the outbreak. First responders are prioritized to receive the vaccine. Vaccine administered up to 4 days after exposure to the virus, and before the rash appears, provides protective immunity and can prevent infection or ameliorate the severity of the disease.\\u2029Immediate Notification of the occurrence of smallpox cases to WHO is formally required by IHR (2005). The risk of emergence of smallpox is extremely low as the remaining global live variola virus stocks are held in two high security laboratory facilities in Russia and the US and the disease has no animal reservoir.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0To detect and immediately respond to a potential re-emergence or any suspected case of smallpox.

It is caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria, and is both treatable and preventable.\\u2029Infections often begin during infancy or childhood and can become chronic. If left untreated, the infection eventually causes the eyelid to turn inwards, which in turn causes the eyelashes to rub on the eyeball, resulting in intense pain and scarring of the front of the eye. This ultimately leads to irreversible blindness, typically between 30 and 40 years of age.\\u2029Trachoma is easily spread through direct personal contact, shared towels and cloths, and flies that have come in contact with the eyes or nose of an infected person.\\u2029WHO estimates that approximately 6 million cases of blindness due to trachoma and 11 million cases of trichiasis occur worldwide each year. Prevalence of active disease in children varies from 10-40% in some African countries.\\u2029The infection primarily affects young children, with blindness occurring later in life. Females are three times more likely than males to suffer from trichiasis, the in-turning of the eyelashes that can lead to blindness. People are most at risk for trachoma infection in areas where there is poor sanitation, lack of latrines, poor sources of clean water, and the presence of flies.\\u2029Primary interventions advocated for preventing trachoma infection include improved sanitation, reduction of fly breeding sites and increased facial cleanliness (with clean water) among children at risk of disease. The scaring and visual change for trachoma can be reversed by a simple surgical procedure performed at village level which reverses the in-turned eyelashes.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Prevention of blindness by early detection\\u2029Identification of high risk areas and epidemiologic trends\\u2029Estimation of disease burden\\u2029Monitoring of control programs\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case:\\u2029Any patient with red sticky eyes who complains of pain and itchiness of the eyes.\\u2029Confirmed case:\\u2029Any patient with red sticky eyes who complains of pain and itchiness of the eyes where examination of the eyes confirms one of the stages of Trachoma infection according to the WHO Simplified Trachoma Grading System.

In Africa it is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma burcei rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense, which are transmitted by the bit of infected Glossina (tsetse) flies.\\u2029Trypanosomiasis is endemic in over 30 African countries in West, Central and East Africa. It is highly epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and other areas of civil conflict, where 80% of some village populations may be infected. Cattle are the major reservoir of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, and humans are the major reservoir for T. b. gambiense.\\u2029Incubation period is usually days to weeks with T. b. rhodesiense, and months to years with T. b. gambiense infections. Without treatment, both forms are usually fatal.\\u2029Trypanosomiasis control strategies include human and cattle population surveys to treat infected persons and diminish cattle reservoirs, and tsetse fly habitat control (for example, removal of bushes and tall grasses near villages, and use of residual insecticides).\\u2029Tuberculosis, malaria, bacterial meningitis, HIV/AIDS, and other central nervous system or systemic infections can produce similar clinical findings.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Increase percentage of cases confirmed by laboratory methods.\\u2029Use population-based surveys and serologic screening for active case finding in endemic areas.\\u2029Conduct human and cattle screening in trypanosomiasis-free areas.\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case:\\u2029Early stage: a painful chancre originating as a papule and then evolving into a nodule at the primary fly bite site.

Clinically, the pulmonary form of the disease is more common than the extra-pulmonary form. The cardinal symptoms of pulmonary TB are chronic cough, weight loss, fever, loss of appetite and night sweats.\\u2029Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of infectious illness and death worldwide with over 8 million new cases and 3 million deaths per year. In African countries, approximately 1.6 million of the new cases and over 600 000 cases occur each year. It is also estimated that between 30 and 50% of all new TB cases detected are infected with HIV and 40% of all AIDS deaths are due to TB. Those who are at highest risk of dying from TB include people with HIV/AIDS, malnutrition and other immuno-compromising conditions, the very young, and the very old.\\u2029The global HIV pandemic has been a major cause of increasing TB cases, especially in African countries.\\u2029Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months.\\u2029WHO recommends the Directly Observed Therapy, Short-course (DOTS) strategy to maximize compliance and treatment efficacy and to reduce development of drug-resistant strains. The DOTS strategy has been implemented by at least 40 of 46 Member States in the African Region. Varying degrees of success have been achieved in controlling TB where resources and motivation for diagnosis, treatment, and patient follow up are adequate.\\u2029Clinically, bacterial pneumonia, malaria, trypanosomiasis, HIV/AIDS and a variety of other bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes of fever, cough, fatigue, and weight loss, or may themselves precipitate active TB in an already infected individual. Abdominal or other extra-pulmonary sites of infection may occur after ingestion of un-pasteurized cow’s milk (M. bovis).\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Early detection of persons with infectious lung disease to improve chances of clinical improvement and reduce transmission of TB.\\u2029Improve percentage of TB cases confirmed by microscope Standard case definition: Tuberculosis\\ufdd0Suspected case:\\u2029Any person with a cough of 3 weeks or more.\\u2029Confirmed case:\\u2029Smear-positive pulmonary TB: a) a suspected patient with at least 2 sputum specimens positive for acid-fast bacilli (AFB), or b) one sputum specimen positive for AFB by microscopy and radiographic abnormalities consistent with active PTB as determined by the treating medical officer, or c) one positive sputum smear by microscopy and one sputum specimen positive on culture for AFB.\\u2029Smear negative PTB: a patient who fulfils all the following criteria: a) two sets taken at least 2 weeks apart of at least two sputum specimens negative for AFB on microscopy, radiographic abnormalities consistent with PTB and a lack of clinical response despite one week of a broad spectrum antibiotic, a decision by a physician to treat with a full course of anti-TB chemotherapy, or b) a patient who fulfils all the following criteria: severely ill, at least two sputum specimens negative for AFB by microscopy, radiographic abnormalities consistent with extensive pulmonary TB (interstitial and miliary), a decision by a physician to treat with a full course of anti-TB chemotherapy, or c) a patient whose initial sputum smears were negative, who had sputum sent for culture initially, and whose subsequent sputum culture result is positive.\\ufdd0Respond to alert threshold\\ufdd0If you observe that the number of cases or deaths is increasing over a period of time:\\u2029Report observed trends to the next level, or according to national guidelines.\\u2029Treat individual cases with direct observation (DOTS) including a treatment supporter.\\u2029Where feasible, isolate persons using respiratory infection control practices, especially if multi-drug resistant TB is suspected.\\u2029Investigate cause of increase, including performance of DOTS program in your area.\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0If the number of cases or deaths increases to two times the number usually seen in a similar period in the past:\\u2029Assess health worker performance with detection and treatment of smear-positive PTB and improve practices as needed.\\u2029Assess DOTS program and take action to make identified improvements.\\u2029Conduct drug susceptibility tests to establish patterns of resistance.\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time:Graph cases and deaths monthly.\\u2029Place:Plot distribution of case households and workplaces.\\u2029Person:Count monthly cases and deaths.

Symptoms usually develop 1–3 weeks after exposure, and may be mild or severe. They include high fever, malaise, headache, constipation or diarrhoea, rose-coloured spots on the chest, and enlarged spleen and liver. Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness.\\u2029Typhoid fever remains a serious public health problem throughout the world, with an estimated 16–33 million cases and 500 000 to 600 000 deaths annually. \\u2029In virtually all endemic areas, the incidence of typhoid fever is highest in children from 5–19 years old. The disease is almost exclusively transmitted by food and water contaminated by the faeces and urine of patients and carriers.\\u2029Polluted water is the most common source of typhoid transmission. In addition, shellfish taken from sewage-contaminated beds, vegetables fertilized with night-soil and eaten raw, contaminated milk and milk products have been shown to be a source of infection.\\u2029Typhoid fever has been virtually eliminated in most areas of the industrialized world with the advent of proper sanitary facilities. Most cases in developed countries are imported from endemic countries.\\u2029People can transmit the disease as long as the bacteria remain in their body; most people are infectious prior to and during the first week of convalescence, but 10% of untreated patients will discharge bacteria for up to 3 months.\\u2029Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread. Healthy carriers should be excluded from handling food.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Detect Typhoid Fever sporadic cases and outbreaks promptly, and seek laboratory verification\\u2029Identify areas/population at high risk in order to improve prevention of the disease by taking hygienic measures\\ufdd0Standard case definitions\\ufdd0Suspected case: Any person with gradual onset of steadily increasing and then persistently high fever, chills, malaise, headache, sore throat, cough, and, sometimes, abdominal pain and constipation or diarrhoea.\\u2029Confirmed case: Suspected case confirmed by isolation of Salmonella typhi from blood, bone marrow, bowel fluid or stool. Respond to alert threshold\\ufdd0If Typhoid fever cases are suspected:\\u2029Arrange for laboratory testing of stool specimens or rectal swabs of suspected cases, especially in situations where food- or waterborne transmission is suspected.\\u2029Report and investigate all suspected outbreaks of typhoid. Search for case/carrier that is the source of infection and for the vehicle (water or food) through which infection is being transmitted.\\u2029Treat typhoid fever patients with antibiotics.

It is the willingness to call an alert about uncertain and worrying events that is the sign of a functional public health system. \\u2029By their nature these events cannot be precisely described but scenarios have been used to help illustrate what might raise concern. The IHR regulations contain a \"decision instrument\" to guide WHO members (Refer to Section 2 of these guidelines). A \"yes\" answer to any two of the following four questions means that an event potentially constitutes a public health emergency of international concern that the WHO member must notify to WHO: (1) Is the public health impact of the event serious? (2) Is the event unusual or unexpected? (3) Is there a significant risk of international spread? (4) Is there a risk of restrictions on international travel or trade?\\u2029The report that there is a possible outbreak or unusual event may come from different sources including: \\u2029routine analysis of surveillance data (e.g. from routine reporting indicates an unexpected increase in cases of a notifiable disease \\u2029a health worker (doctor, nurse or CHA, Environmental health Technician (EHT)) who reports a cluster of patients with a certain disease at their HCF or in the community \\u2029a community leader who notices an unusual health event in their community and reports it to the authorities \\u2029Continued reporting of these events from the local level are contingent on the willingness of the district, County/Regional and National levels to listen and give credibility to the local levels. The responsiveness of the system to these alerts will define the likelihood that they will be reported and vigilance continues. \\u2029A literature review into the important obstacles for reporting Public Health Events of International concern found the following: \\u2029Lack of knowledge among clinicians of the reporting process, including not knowing what diseases are reportable and not knowing what to report. Often there is confusion over who is responsible for reporting between the hospital and laboratory as well as confusion over whether laboratory confirmation is required prior to reporting. \\u2029A lack of understanding of how information acquired through reporting is used and a perception that reporting diseases is a useless endeavour. \\u2029The effect of actual or perceived negative consequences associated with reporting, such as extra work, intrusive requests for further information, media attention, judgment, punishment or blame, was stressed as an obstacle by multiple respondents. \\u2029Strategies to enhance completeness of notifiable disease reporting and IHR events include the following: \\u2029Provide clear information to frontline staff about \\u2029Why report unusual events? \\u2029What events are reportable? \\u2029How to report an unusual event? \\u2029What happens after you report? \\u2029Examples of event reporting:\\u2029Strengthen the ability to ask questions and get immediate feedback between clinicians and other key partners to encourage more complete reporting, such as by providing access to public health professionals in the case of emergencies and establishing a 24-hour toll free phone number for reporting. \\u2029More frequent field visits or phone conferences can help as well. \\u2029Feedback to clinicians and others in the reporting chain, showing them that preventative action is being taken as a result of their notification, helps emphasize the need for timely and complete reporting. Providing feedback to those reporting could increase trust and transparency in the exchange of information about unusual events, improve the perception of how reported information is used and demonstrate the consequences of not reporting \\u2029All surveillance is built on good personal relationships or knowledge of the individuals involved in reporting. Encourage relationship building.  \\u2029How reported information is handled: \\u2029The IHR has national focal points that contact their counterparts at WHO regional Offices. These regional offices enter epidemiological and other information necessary for risk analysis and management into an event management system that stores the information and makes it available. Feedback to countries through a national IHR focal point completes the reporting link and, if countries require support in outbreak response, a request is transmitted back to the WHO.\\u2029This most recent guidance from WHO/AFRO focuses on Public Health Events (PHE) of initially unknown aetiology, which are PHEs for which the cause has not yet been determined. For such events, the One Health approach is recommended, where the ministry of health works in close collaboration with other ministries and multi-sectoral partners to enhance teamwork and improve efficiencies in preparedness, response, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0The assessment of whether an event may potentially be of international significance occurs at the national level, guided by Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) which is not intended to be used sub-nationally. \\u2029In this definition of an “event” or death sensitivity is prioritized to facilitate reporting and to reduce delays, emphasizing the fact that there should be no negative consequences f\\\\or a potentially false signal. \\u2029Detect cases. \\u2029Immediate case-based reporting of all cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks. Standard case definition \\ufdd0These events are not well detailed or standardized at this time.

It is a zoonotic disease transmitted from birds to humans and other animals. Serological evidence suggests that the infection is present throughout practically the entire African continent. West Nile Fever most likely emerged in Africa and is now found world-wide. Outbreaks occur in humans, birds and horses.\\u2029Most cases are mild and may not come to the attention of the health system. Patients seeking health care usually present with flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache and body aches. Occasionally patients present with a skin rash on the neck, trunk, arms or legs.\\u2029People of all ages and conditions may be affected. However, those who are above age 50 years or who have had an organ transplant are at increased risk of severe illness.\\u2029Very severe cases include signs of encephalitis, meningo-encephalitis or meningitis. Symptoms include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, tremors, convulsions, flaccid paralysis and coma.\\u2029The case fatality rate in patients with neurological involvement ranges from 4% to 14% and as high as 29% in elderly patients.\\u2029West Nile Fever can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites especially at dusk when mosquitoes are most active. Insect repellents, wearing long sleeves and trousers, staying indoors and draining breeding sites like pools of standing water can reduce exposure to mosquitoes.\\u2029Confirmation of West Nile Fever in patients with clinical symptoms requires laboratory confirmation of specific IgM antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens.\\u2029Because there is no specific treatment for West Nile Fever, patients with severe disease are usually hospitalized for supportive treatment and nursing care.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Identify risk factors for infection and determine high-risk populations for targeted prevention activities\\u2029Identify geographic areas for targeted prevention and control activities\\u2029Identify most severe cases for referral to hospitalized care\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case:\\u2029A hospitalized case of encephalitis due to unknown cause\\u2029Confirmed case:\\u2029Confirmation of West Nile Fever is through laboratory diagnostics to identify WNV-specific IgM West Nile Fever Respond to alert threshold\\ufdd0If a single case is suspected:\\u2029Report case-based information immediately to the appropriate levels.\\u2029Treat and manage the patient with supportive care.\\u2029Collect specimen safely to confirm the case.\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0If a single case is confirmed:\\u2029Treat and manage the patient with supportive care\\u2029Mobilise the community through education in order to promote adoption of behaviours that reduce disease risk such as protection against mosquito bites and reduction of mosquito breeding sites\\u2029Conduct community education on how WNV is transmitted and on how to prevent being infected\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time:Construct an epidemic curve during the outbreak.\\u2029Place:Plot location of case residence and worksite.\\u2029Person:Immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths.

The papilloma is a typical presentation of yaws and clinical diagnosis is straightforward. Without treatment, the papilloma will ulcerate. Papilloma and ulcers are very infectious and in the absence of treatment can quickly spread to other persons. Other clinical forms of yaws exist but they are not very infectious. Apart of papilloma and ulcers, other lesions of yaws and bejel range from macules, papules, nodules, plaques to secondary yaws that occurs weeks to months after the primary infection and typically presents with multiple raised yellow lesions or pain and swelling of long bones and fingers (dactylitis). \\u2029Yaws spreads in inter-tropical areas, in humid and warm zones such as equatorial rain forests and their surroundings, while bejel is found in most dry and arid regions such as the Sahel trip \\u2029Children from 2 to 14 years old are the most affected age-group, especially in school-age children where outbreaks of yaws or bejel could be observed\\u2029Yaws treatment which was based on single injection of long lasting penicillin (benzathine benzyl penicillin) has improved greatly by the confirmation of the efficacy of a single dose of Azithromycin for curing yaws lesion in 2010. Further to this confirmation, the WHO has designed a yaws eradication strategy, titled “The Morges Strategy” from the name of a city near Geneva, where the Strategy was drafted in 2012. This eradication strategy consists mainly in mass administration of azithromycin (MAA) to at-risk communities and achieving at least 90% coverage of targeted populations\\u2029The mode of transmission is through direct contact with skin lesions or items already contaminated by primary lesions (papilloma and ulcers) \\u2029Confirmation of diagnosis is done by dual treponemal and non-treponemal rapid tests, a syphilis test which is not specific for yaws followed by a dual path platform (DPP) test which is specific for T. p; pertenue. These rapid tests can be performed in the fields and are able to detect recent and past infections\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Yaws is targeted for eradication by 2020, eradication being defined as complete interruption of transmission (zero new case of yaws) globally. The surveillance goals are to 1) ensure detection of any new case of yaws in a given area for implementing the eradication strategy and 2) after stopping transmission, maintain active case search for at least three years to certify yaws eradication\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\u2029\\u2029Suspected case: a person with a history of residence in an endemic area (past or present) who presents with clinically active (visible) yaws lesions\\u2029Confirmed case: a suspected case with a positive serological test (rapid treponemal test for syphilis confirmed by DPP test)\\u2029Imported case: a person who presents with clinically active yaws serologically confirmed in an area where yaws is not known to be endemic\\u2029Index case: first case of yaws which is detected in a community \\u2029Contact of a case: a person who has close, frequent contact with the infected person.

Brazzaville, Congo, from 13 to 15 October 2010\\u2029 Zika virus disease Background \\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Zika virus is a flavivirus that is transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito, primarily Aedes aegypti, and also Aedes albopictus, the same mosquitoes that transmit dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever.\\u2029Zika virus can also be transmitted in-utero from mother to fetus, and through sexual contact, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation. \\u2029Zika virus infections are usually asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they tend to be mild and include mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and muscle and joint pain that last for 2 to 7 days. There is no specific treatment but symptoms can be treated with common fever medicines, rest and drinking fluids.   \\u2029Zika virus infection during pregnancy can result in preterm birth, fetal loss, stillbirth, and congenital malformations including microcephaly, limb contractures, eye abnormalities, brain calcifications, and other manifestations of Congenital Zika Syndrome.   \\u2029Zika virus is also associated with an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neurological complications requiring close medical management and possibly intensive care and mechanical ventilation.\\u2029\\u2029History\\u2029Zika virus was first identified in 1947 in a rhesus monkey the Zika forest of Uganda, and was first identified in humans in 1952 in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. Over the following decades, Zika virus caused rare, sporadic cases of disease in Africa and Asia, generally causing mild and self-limited illness of fever, rash, malaise, and other mild symptoms. \\u2029The first outbreaks were reported in Yap Island (Federated States of Micronesia) in 2007 and French Polynesia in 2013. The virus subsequently spread to other Pacific islands including New Caledonia, Cook Islands, Vanuatu and Easter Island (Chile), Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Zika virus was not known to cause severe disease until the 2013-2014 outbreak in French Polynesia, where increased incidence of Guillain-Barré Syndrome was first reported. \\u2029The Zika virus outbreak in the Region of the Americas began in Brazil in 2015; in July 2015, Brazil reported an association between Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and few months later, in October 2015, an association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly.\\u2029Since 2015, outbreaks of Zika virus disease have now been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific; to date, 86 countries and territories have confirmed evidence of mosquito-borne  Zika transmission.  Since 2017, Zika virus transmission in the Americas has waned, but transmission continues with intermittent areas of emergence and re-emergence.\\u2029In the African Region, only rare, sporadic Zika virus infection had been reported until 2015. Since 2015, outbreaks of Zika virus have been reported in Cabo Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and Angola.\\u2029There are two strains of Zika virus known as the African and Asian strains. The Asian strain was associated with the outbreaks in the Pacific and in the Americas. The Asian strain was also identified in the Cabo Verde outbreak and in Angola. In Angola, a cluster of microcephaly was reported in 2017-2018, and introduction of the epidemic (Brazilian) Asian strain was confirmed, including among infants born with microcephaly. To date, microcephaly has only been identified following infection with the Asian strain. Little information is available on the spectrum of disease and pregnancy risk associated with the African strain.\\u2029Aedes mosquitoes that transmit Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya primarily bite during daylight hours.  Aedes sp. breed in small collections of water such as in trash, used tyres, flower pots, and open water storage containers. Efforts to prevent transmission focus on elimination of these breeding sites around homes and near other areas of human-vector contact such as around schools and work sites. Other prevention strategies include use of personal protection measures such as use of protective clothing, insect repellent, and screens on windows and doors.\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Surveillance goals\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0The goal of surveillance is to develop, strengthen and implement integrated surveillance systems at all levels for Zika virus disease, its complications, and other arboviral diseases and their vectors, in order to provide up-to-date and accurate epidemiological and entomological information to guide response.\\u2029Existing surveillance systems should be enhanced for early detection and reporting of Zika virus and unusual clusters of neurological disorders or birth defects. \\u2029Timely notification of any event compatible with Zika virus is important, and in particular any associated with neurological disorders and neonatal malformations through established channels, including IHR.\\u2029The establishment or strengthening of event-based or syndromic surveillance should be supported, potentially targeting specific groups for surveillance, such as pregnant women through antenatal and postnatal care, sentinel based surveillance systems for birth defects and Guillain-Barré syndrome, and existing lab-based disease specific surveillance systems (e.g. measles, polio) to facilitate detection of Zika virus infection and associated disorders.

The adverse event may be any unfavourable or unintended sign, abnormal laboratory finding, symptom or disease. Programmes providing immunization services should include a system for AEFI detection and reporting, investigation and management, data analysis, corrective action, relevant communication and evaluation of the system. The ultimate goal of an investigation is to determine whether the vaccine or immunization process is responsible for the reported event (s) or to find another cause and correct it if possible, and reassure the public.\\u2029Further resources:\\u2029Definition and application of terms for vaccine pharmacovigilance.

Listing each case and their information will help provide the data needed to assess characteristics of cases to help guide response activities. This is an important tool to collect information and analyse quickly.  During an outbreak, the line list must be established and used as a primary data collection tool. The columns under the IDSR Line List should be changed based on the situation. The information from each reported case should be added to a single row in the spreadsheet. This paper form should be routinely incorporated in the IDSR Routinely Reported Database to facilitate comprehensive analysis and reporting to next level daily as well as on weekly basis.

Eradication: the confirmed absence of clinical manifestations (the interruption of transmission of Dracunculus medinensis in human and animal) for three years or longer at the global level. (2)  Testing should be according to local guidance for management of community‐acquired pneumonia. Examples of other aetiologies include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Legionella pneumophila, other recognized primary bacterial pneumonias, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. (3)  For a map of the Middle East, see: http://www.un.org/Depts /Cartographic/map/profile/mideastr.pdf (4)  A ‘cluster’ is defined as two or more persons with onset of symptoms within the same 14 day period, and who are associated with a specific setting such as a classroom, workplace, household, extended family, hospital, other residential institution, military barracks or recreational camp.

However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats.  The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi adopted in 2014. Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using new guidelines for the IDSR revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018. This Third Edition has now been reviewed to include the new developments. The manual contains practical guidelines for use as a general reference for surveillance activities at all levels; and as a resource material for developing training, supervision and evaluation of surveillance activities. It is worth noting that, many public health events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate. To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to implement these IDSR technical guidelines. These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.  Dr. Charles Mwansambo Secretary for Health ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The third edition of the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) Technical Guidelines was prepared by the WHO Health Emergencies (WHE) Programme with active participation and involvement of programmes dealing with disease surveillance at the WHO Regional Office for Africa (AFRO), Brazzaville, Congo with technical reviews provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Malawi adapted the revised IDSR technical guidelines with the purpose of:  aligning with the current situation and needs of the Member States; aligning with the objectives, targets and elements of the WHO Africa region’s strategy for health security and emergencies 2016 to 2020;  updating the technical guidelines with contemporary information, taking into consideration new developments such as: emerging and re-emerging priority diseases, conditions and events; incorporating recent recommendations from expert panels on strengthening the IHR, 2005 that are underpinned on the One Health approach; holistically addressing disaster risk management (DRM) strategies;  taking into account lessons learnt from the unprecedented EVD outbreak in West Africa, polio eradication and other humanitarian crises; taking advantage of technology advancement and utilize the opportunities offered by the internet and mobile phones to scale up the implementation of real time community event based surveillance (CEBS), with robust geographical information system (GIS) platforms; scaling up other electronic surveillance systems and incorporate new ways for capacity building using the IDSR eLearning tools.

Introduction  Humanitarian emergencies  have major implications on the populations where they occur and on their health services including surveillance systems (WHO, 2012). Emergencies typically result in population displacement to congested settings where access to basic needs like water, food, shelter, and other social services are constrained. These conditions thus increase the risk of death from common epidemic and endemic diseases.  Consequently, effective public health surveillance and outbreak response is a priority during public health emergencies in affected populations. Due to the disruption of health and other social services during the emergencies, the routine IDSR system need to be enhanced to meet the public health surveillance and outbreak response needs in humanitarian contexts. In these settings, IDSR should be tailored to the prevailing context to meet the additional emergency needs. In these settings, an Enhanced IDSR system should be established to address the humanitarian emergency. The system set up should be based on the IDSR strategy, structures, tools, guidelines and resources while ensuring the flexibility required in addressing the surveillance and response needs of affected populations in emergency situations. This should be done within the existing national IDSR system.   This section introduces key principles of implementing IDSR in complex humanitarian emergencies. This will involve enhancing IDSR core functions to ensure early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events. For more detailed description, please refer to the WHO document on early detection, assessment and response to acute public health events- implementation of early warning and response with focus on event-based surveillance, (WHO, 2014). 10.1 Health information system in emergency contexts\\xa0 Acute and protracted crises have major immediate and long-term effects on population health and health systems. Conflicts and disasters create disruptions in the overall functionality of the health system. The routine IDSR system may be underperforming or disrupted. Thus, there is a need to tailor the IDSR to adequately meet surveillance information needs of a humanitarian emergency. Examples of such humanitarian emergencies include: armed conflict, famine, natural disasters and other major\\xa0emergencies. 10.1.1 Key definitions in Emergency contexts  10.1.1.1 Disaster A serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses which exceed the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources (International Strategy for Disaster Reduction [ISDR], 2009). A disaster is also defined as a situation or event, which overwhelms local capacity, necessitating additional national or international assistance (Center for Research on Environmental Decisions [CRED, ReliefWeb, 2008). 10.1.1.2 Humanitarian emergency A situation where the basic human needs of a population are threatened and therefore requires extra-ordinary measures and urgent action (ReliefWeb, 2008). 10.1.1.3 Complex emergency  A humanitarian crisis in a country, region or society where there is total or considerable breakdown of authority resulting from internal or external conflict and which requires an international response that goes beyond the mandate or capacity of any single and/or ongoing UN country programme (ReliefWeb, 2008). 10.2 Early Warning and Response  Early warning is an organized mechanism to detect as early as possible any abnormal occurrence or any divergence from the usual or normally observed frequency of diseases, conditions and events. It relies on a network of people either from functional static or mobile health facilities/clinics that are responsible for the collection, investigation, reporting, analysis and dissemination of information from the field to the central level for appropriate action.  10.2.1 Why is it needed?  The enhanced surveillance needs during humanitarian emergencies demand that surveillance systems are in place for systematic collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of data, and dissemination of information to facilitate public health response to prevent excess morbidity, mortality and disability (WHO, 2009).  Consequently, during the acute phase of a humanitarian emergency, IDSR should be modified as soon as possible to focus on priority health problems during the emergency phase. The tailored IDSR should focus on diseases, conditions or events for a given emergency context and should be flexible enough  to respond to other emerging public health priorities (WHO, 2009).  During emergencies, populations are more vulnerable to morbidity, mortality and disability resulting from endemic and epidemic prone diseases. Thus, IDSR should be enhanced within 3-10 days of grading the public health emergency to facilitate rapid detection and response to disease outbreaks and public health events (WHO, 2009). Ultimately, this will contribute to the overall goal of reducing avoidable mortality, morbidity, and disability during humanitarian crises (WHO, 2009b).  10.2.2 What are the objectives of tailoring IDSR to emergency context? The main objective is to rapidly detect and control acute public health events of any origin, with particular attention to prioritized health risks. The aim is to increase sensitivity of detection, quality of risk assessment, and timeliness and effectiveness of the response to acute public health risks in order to minimize the negative health consequences to the affected population. The specific objectives are to:  Detect early an acute public health events and health risks;  Ensure immediate communication of information from local and intermediate levels to national levels as well as from any source identified at the national level;  Verify the initial information (i.e. signal);  Document the nature of the event through investigation, characterization, etiological confirmation;  Perform risk assessment to determine the level of risk posed by the detected event;  Ensure immediate alert mechanisms from national and/or intermediate levels to local levels;  Ensure prompt investigation as necessary and implement an adequate response through mitigation and control measures, as required by the continuous risk assessment; and  Alert and maintain communication/coordination with national/international stakeholders  10.2.3 Critical components During humanitarian crises, all functional static and mobile health facilities/clinics including Internally Displaced Persons (IDP)/refugee camp clinics that provide curative, disease prevention and health promotion interventions should be included in the IDSR network to enhance the sensitivity of the system (WHO, 2009). Depending on the extent of the crisis, the surveillance network may include government and/or partner-supported clinics (WHO, 2012).  To ensure efficiency, the data collection and analysis processes need to be systematized and formalized. Epidemic intelligence should be based on the two main IDSR event detection systems, namely: indicator-based surveillance (immediate and weekly reporting of data aggregated by health facilities) and event-based surveillance, which is the organized collection, monitoring, assessment and interpretation of mainly unstructured ad hoc information regarding health events or risks. These complementary systems increase the sensitivity  of IDSR to ensure timely detection and verification of outbreaks, and effective monitoring of morbidity patterns (WHO, 2012) 10.3 Implementation of IDSR in humanitarian emergencies 10.3.1 Rapid assessment of the situation During the acute phase of the emergency it is helpful to undertake a systematic assessment of the risk of acute public health events. This involves gauging both the likelihood of a disease occurring and its eventual impact. The assessment can identify the epidemic-prone diseases that have the potential to cause the greatest amount of morbidity and mortality in the affected population, and determine the geographical scope of surveillance. The assessment is also done on the status of key surveillance infrastructure, including existing surveillance capacity, identification of resource needs for IDSR implementation, including staff with relevant skills, communication and IT equipment laboratory support and transport. The assessment should be based on consensus-building, analysis of existing data, establishment of working groups and conducting in-depth interviews, as required. It should be based on an all-hazards approach and be repeated as the emergency evolves, to account for changes. 10.3.2 Gap analysis The gap analysis should be performed to complement the situation analysis and the assessment of the surveillance system. It aims to assess the specific needs and environment, and to review the strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities around the existing national surveillance system in order to identify available resources to reinforce IDSR. Gap analysis does not require a new or additional formal evaluation be carried out. The results of previous evaluations of the surveillance system can be reused for the gap analysis. If not all information is available, focus groups or in-depth interviews with stakeholders at all levels of the surveillance system could be considered. 10.3.3 Prioritization In order to ensure the most efficient use of resources, the strategy should be based on a prioritization exercise, the results of the gap analysis and the list of priority events for surveillance. For each selected disease, condition or event surveillance objectives need to be specified based on the country’s context. The objectives will depend on the characteristics of the disease, condition or event (e.g. attack rate, morbidity and mortality, setting), the mode of transmission (e.g. person to person, point source outbreaks, exposure to toxic substances), and the nature of the public health interventions required to control spread. 10.3.4 Development of a plan of action for the implementation of IDSR Once the prioritization exercise has been completed and all potential sources of information listed, a plan of action should be developed and implemented at the national, intermediate and local levels. The plan of action should be well-integrated with the national IDSR system, including monitoring and evaluation.  10.3.5 Designate a coordination mechanism A coordination structure should be established at the national and intermediate levels to ensure a single entry point for reporting, analysis and triaging information, verifying signals, assessing risks, and monitoring and responding to acute public health events.  10.4 Various actors in enhancing IDSR to improve early warning and response During acute or complex emergencies, where the capacity of the National and district IDSR system in the MoH is greatly constrained, the roles and responsibilities of various actors may need to be re-enforced: 10.4.1 Central/National level  The overall coordination of data collection, entry, analysis and dissemination during humanitarian crises should be undertaken by the IDSR unit within the Ministry of Health (MoH) with support from WHO and partners, and fed as necessarily to the PHEOC if one already exists. If the PHEOC exists, the National Public Health Emergency Management Committee (PHEMC) coordinated by the national PHEOC is activated to support the coordination and response activities in the affected regions and districts. However, during acute crises or complex emergencies where the capacity of the national surveillance coordination unit in the MoH is greatly constrained, a coordinator (typically an epidemiologist or public health expert with experience in disease surveillance and disease control in emergencies) can be recruited to support the Ministry of Health during the acute phase of the crisis (WHO, 2012). The functions of the coordinator will be guided by the initial rapid assessment and   should include but not be limited to: Dedicated technical oversight;  Coordinate the supervision of surveillance and outbreak response activities in crisis affected areas;  Guide coordination of health workers and partners for effective disease surveillance and outbreak/public health response in crisis affected populations; Support districts/provinces or regions to investigate and respond to outbreaks or public health events including reorientation of staff in IDSR; Conduct regular analysis of epidemiological trends and production of regular surveillance bulletins and situation reports; Provide aids for reporting and notifying priority diseases, conditions and events Support evaluation. 10.4.2 District The existing IDSR focal points at district, level should coordinate surveillance and response activities in crisis-affected populations. However, during acute crises or complex emergencies where the capacities of or national/central surveillance focal points are constrained, WHO country office working in close collaboration with the health cluster should assign a partner or a focal point in each affected district to: Coordinate disease surveillance and outbreak response in crisis-affected populations; Ensure timely reporting of priority diseases, conditions and events related to the crisis Conduct trend analyses and provide feedback to health facilities and clinics; Conduct initial investigation of disease outbreaks and public health events; Respond to disease outbreaks and public health emergencies in collaboration with national MoH, partners, and local health facilities.  10.4.3 Public and partner-supported health facilities or clinics  All identified focal persons working in health facilities or mobile clinics offering curative, preventive, and health promotion services should implement the following:  Detect, collect and report priority diseases, conditions and events; Support the verification and investigation of outbreaks and public health events;  Implement public health and outbreak response measures with support from the community focal persons, district and national surveillance focal points  10.5 Key structures and tools to be put in place during an acute humanitarian crisis 10.5.1 List of diseases/conditions/events  During the acute phase of a humanitarian crisis, a rapid risk assessment should be undertaken to identify diseases, conditions, and events that pose a threat to the population. These should be prioritised in addition to the national IDSR priority list. In identifying the list of additional priority diseases, conditions and events, criteria for inclusion should take into account WHO guidelines for inclusion of an event under a surveillance system (WHO, 2012), namely: Epidemic; Vaccine preventable diseases due to disruption of immunization in most of the emergencies; Ability to cause severe morbidity or death; International surveillance requirements (IHR, 2005); Availability of prevention and control measures; Availability of reliable and meaningful case definitions and simple laboratory tests, where appropriate. It is critical that clinicians register the most important diagnosis per patient and that only new case visits are counted and not the follow up visits.  The sources of data on new cases include:  Outpatient clinics  Inpatient clinics,  Laboratory Mobile clinics in the community or from focal people identified from community IDP/refugee camp clinics Other sources of event based information  10.5.2 Case definitions  For the diseases, conditions, and events already included on the IDSR priority disease list, the existing case definitions should be used. Sensitive case definitions that increase the chances of detecting new outbreaks should be developed for the additional diseases, conditions, events, and syndromes identified as part of the risk assessment. These case definitions should be simple, standardized, and harmonized with the national IDSR case definitions.  10.5.3 Laboratory support  Quality assured WHO approved Point of care Rapid Diagnostic Test (RDT) kits for diseases like Malaria, Cholera, Meningitis, and Hepatitis A and E are essential for timely treatment and outbreak response decisions.  Laboratory confirmation is more critical for suspected outbreaks in crisis affected populations and the following should be in place to facilitate timely investigation of new outbreaks:  Adequate stocks of outbreak and sample collection kits/SOPs at the local level; Cold chain and shipping arrangements that are linked to the national specimen transportation network; Establishing field or mobile laboratories to address the routine and outbreak laboratory testing needs of crisis affected populations; Strengthening existing laboratories at national and sub-national levels to address the extra demands of crisis affected populations; Referral laboratories (national and international) should be identified to facilitate laboratory confirmation, antibiotic susceptibility testing and quality control; The existing IDSR laboratory and case investigation forms should be used for routine collection and reporting of laboratory aggregate and case based data; Harmonization of laboratory reporting between surveillance and laboratory systems for timely dissemination of results; 10.5.4 Methods of data collection  Data should be collected on reportable alerts and priority diseases, conditions, and events that are generated from data sources such as inpatient and outpatient clinics, mobile clinics, laboratories, disease-specific active case search or outbreak investigations, community health workers, community alerts, and other sources of disease surveillance data. Health workers should observe the following standards:  Strict adherence to the case definitions while collecting disease, conditions or event data.  Each patient should be assigned one main diagnosis and counted once; New and follow up visits should be coded separately in the health facility register. The data collection will entail the following paper-based tools and/or electronic platforms:  Health Management Information System (HMIS) outpatient and inpatient registers; IDSR immediate case-based and laboratory investigation form; IDSR Weekly/Monthly Summary Reporting form; IDSR health facility alert logbook; Disease specific line lists; Generic or disease-specific case investigation forms;  Mortality line lists; 10.5.5 Data reporting and transmission methods  Humanitarian crises tend to disrupt existing national disease surveillance platforms for transmitting data. In the same way, crisis-affected populations may have additional public health needs beyond the ones established through the routine IDSR. Flexibility should be exercised to update the existing IDSR/HMIS reporting tools to capture diseases, conditions, and events unique to crisis affected populations. Consequently, the existing IDSR/HMIS paper-based tools and/or electronic reporting platforms should be updated to capture the additional diseases, condition, and public health events that are unique to crisis affected populations.  The reporting platforms (paper based and/or electronic) should provide for the following reporting timelines:  Immediate reporting of epidemic prone disease alerts; Daily reporting of aggregated and/or case based data on priority diseases, conditions, events during the acute phase of the crisis and after a new outbreak is confirmed; Weekly reporting of aggregated data on priority diseases; Weekly mortality line listing should be updated with community and health facility deaths and reported. 10.5.6 Data analysis and interpretation  The principles of data analysis utilized as part of the routine IDSR should be used in crisis affected populations. Analysis on aggregated data is therefore conducted to document and describe disease trends and crossing of thresholds. The data is also used to calculate ratios, rates.  Before embarking on any analysis, data validation and cleaning should be undertaken for missing entries, outliers, and duplicates. The basic analysis entail case/death descriptive analysis by time, person, and place.  Morbidity indicators in crisis affected populations include:  Absolute counts of cases and deaths by priority disease  Incidence of disease (new cases by week divided by the total population) with a graph to show trends from recent weeks. This can be disaggregated by location and person characteristics Proportional morbidity (new cases of disease in a week divided by the new consultations in the week)  Case fatality ratio (CFR) – the proportion of cases that die from a specific disease Attack rate during outbreaks as the cumulative incidence of epidemic disease in a population over a period of time.  The mortality indicators in crisis affected populations: It is critical that mortality rates (CMR and U5MR) are monitored for crisis affected populations to ensure that rates exceeding the established emergency threshold are detected and responded to promptly.  Crude Mortality Rate (CMR) as deaths per 10,000 per day is calculated as the number of deaths divided by the population present during the period and the total number of days over which the deaths were reported.  U5MR as deaths per 10,000 per day is calculated as the number of deaths in under-fives divided by the population of under-fives present during the period and the total number of days over which the deaths were reported.  The existing electronic platforms offer the advantage of automated analyses for both routine and case based outbreak data thus saving time and ensuring analysed data is available in real-time to inform disease surveillance and outbreak response decisions at all levels.  10.5.7 Feedback and dissemination  Feedback is critical for ensuring full engagement of the stakeholders. In addition, to informing disease control efforts, information providers must be included in feedback. Weekly surveillance summaries, bulletins, and presentations should be presented and reviewed during; Weekly IDSR or outbreak committee meetings  Health and WASH (and other relevant) cluster meetings  Other relevant disease control meetings.  Extension of all reporting units and stakeholders to inform public health response decisions; Outbreaks, regular situation reports should be shared with all stakeholders The existing electronic platforms offer the advantage of producing automated disease surveillance and epidemic bulletins or situation reports to inform disease surveillance and outbreak response decisions at all levels.  10.5.8 Support functions for surveillance in crisis affected populations  To optimize the functioning of disease surveillance and outbreak response in crisis affected populations, it is critical that IDSR guidelines are adapted and used to improve access to the following:  Surveillance and outbreak response guidelines at all levels;  Training of health workers, surveillance focal persons or points, and rapid response teams on surveillance functions including outbreak preparedness, investigation, and response; Support to communication (computers, phones, internet connectivity) based on local context and surveillance needs; Regular supervision and support to enhance surveillance functions at all levels; Periodic evaluation to improve the performance of the surveillance system (refer to framework for evaluating surveillance systems). 10.5.9 Outbreak preparedness  Outbreak preparedness is paramount given the heightened risk of disease outbreaks in crisis affected populations. Preparedness efforts should as much as possible be integrated in the existing national IDSR framework at national and sub-national levels with the Ministry of Health leading the efforts and supported by WHO and partners. However, during acute or complex emergencies where the capacities of the Ministry of Health are greatly compromised or diminished, WHO working with the health cluster partners should take lead to enhance outbreak preparedness (WHO, 2012). The key preparedness efforts in crisis affected populations should entail the following:  Strengthening existing or forming new multi-sectoral outbreak control teams at national and sub national levels, with roles and responsibilities designated for each team member; Updating existing or developing new outbreak prevention and response plans that incorporate risks unique to crisis affected populations; Development or updating (if necessary) of standard line-list forms for data collection during an outbreak; Development and distribution of standard treatment protocols for key diseases, with strategies for training of staff; Calculation of potential attack rates for epidemic-prone diseases, where possible; Pre-positioning stocks of essential treatment supplies to initiate outbreak control (e.g. oral rehydration salts, intravenous fluids, vaccination material, personal protective equipment, transport media for samples, water purification supplies, disinfectants, spray pumps and information leaflets on preventive measures for health staff or the community; Procurement of laboratory sample collection for the priority diseases, and identification of a competent laboratory for confirmation of cases; Identification of potential sites for isolation and adequate treatment of patients, or for extra capacity in the event of a surge in cases (e.g. a cholera treatment centre); Implementation of relevant prevention measures based on the risk assessment of diseases (e.g. measles and cholera vaccination, indoor-residual spraying of dwellings and distribution of long-lasting insecticide-treated nets to prevent outbreaks of measles, cholera, and malaria). Accelerate preparedness and response efforts/ activating rapid response teams at the Points of Entry (PoE)  10.5.9.1 Alert and epidemic thresholds  The following thresholds are used in crisis affected populations:  Assess the severity of the humanitarian crisis based on the crude mortality rate (CMR) and under five mortality rate (U5MR) The crude mortality rate threshold should be less than 1 death per 10,000 people per day; The under-five mortality rate threshold should be less than 2 deaths per 10,000 people per day; Alert system for detecting possible outbreaks based on doubling of weekly incidence compared to the weekly average of previous 2-3 weeks; Detection of a case of potentially severe epidemic prone disease like measles, polio, cholera, viral haemorrhagic fevers (VHF) or meningitis based on the IDSR alert and action thresholds specific to crisis affected populations.  Once the thresholds are exceeded, verifications, investigations, and response should be instituted promptly to prevent further morbidity and mortality.   10.5.9.2 Alert verification To minimize morbidity and mortality, alert verification should start immediately once the alert is received by sub-national and national surveillance focal points (WHO, 2012). The verification can be done by telephone or site visit and can include the collection of information about: Cases based on Standard Case Definitions (SCDs); Symptoms and signs (consider differential diagnoses); Date of onset of symptoms of the first and the most recently detected cases; Place and date seen or admitted at the health facility; Age, sex and vaccination status of patients, where relevant; Place of residence at onset of illness; Where cases are occurring (community-level data); Geographical, personal and time relationships between cases; Prompt laboratory investigation of samples form suspected cases   Outcomes including, for example, deaths, case management details and the health-care staff affected. 10.5.10 Outbreak investigation  Outbreak investigation involves determining the cause of an outbreak and who is at risk, so that control measures can be implemented. The main objective of an outbreak investigation is to control the outbreak and thus reduce morbidity and mortality. The investigation should begin as soon as an alert is detected and has been verified.  The investigations should be undertaken by rapid response teams at national and sub-national levels that have been established as part of the national IDSR framework. In acute and complex emergencies, dedicated and trained teams will be identified to undertake the investigations. The investigations should follow existing IDSR outbreak investigation guidelines that have been adapted to address the unique needs of crisis affected populations.  10.5.11 Outbreak response  Outbreak response should follow the existing national IDSR framework at national and sub-national levels with the country’s existing structures leading the efforts. However, during acute or complex emergencies where the capacities of the Ministry of Health are greatly compromised or diminished, WHO working with the health cluster partners should take lead in coordinating and implementing outbreak response activities. The additional risks in crisis affected populations will demand strengthening existing or formation of new multi-sectoral outbreak control teams at national and sub national levels, with roles and responsibilities designated for each team member as set out in the IDSR outbreak response guidelines. Health, Water Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) and other relevant cluster partners should support outbreak response activities in crisis affected populations.  10.6 Exit strategy  During the recovery phase of the crisis, the Ministry of Health should work with WHO and partners to re-establish all the IDSR structures and focal points in the crisis affected populations. Countries should aim at conducting an evaluation to assess what happened, why it happened and document lessons learnt and gaps identified to inform the recommendations to prevent future occurrence. 10.7 References  ReliefWeb.

However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats.  The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi subsequently adapted in 2014.  Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. Emerging and re-emerging diseases and conditions pose a threat to the country’s health security.  Responding to health emergencies remains a major challenge, as shown by recent health emergencies in the country as well as the African region, the unprecedented Ebola Virus Disease of 2014, the ongoing Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic. Specifically, challenges in capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats have been identified.. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using the Third Edition of the guidelines for IDSR as revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018 and adapted to our context in 2020.  It is worth noting that, many Public Health Events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate.\\xa0 To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to\\xa0 implement these IDSR technical guidelines. These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Therefore, it is important that we scale up and fully implement this third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in the country as they explicitly describe what needs to be established at each level of the health system in order to detect, confirm and respond to diseases, conditions and health events that are responsible for\\xa0 illness, deaths and disability in local communities.  The cost of good public health surveillance as a public health good is relatively very low compared to many other strategies. Let us all embrace these IDSR technical guidelines to strengthen capacities for preparedness, alert and response for health security in the country.  These guidelines are to be used by all relevant multisectoral stakeholders at all levels as general reference for surveillance activities, set of standard definitions for threshold levels that initiate action for responding to specific diseases, stand-alone reference for level-specific responsibilities, resource for developing training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of surveillance activities, and as a guide for improving early detection and response of epidemic prone diseases.  Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.

Both monitoring and evaluation helps to understand if the system has been working effectively. By evaluating information regularly, for example, at the end of a year, supervisors can decide if surveillance and response objectives have been achieved and if they are of high quality. Through supervision, supervisors and health professional work together to review progress, identify problems, decide what has caused the problem and develop feasible solutions. Sustainable supervision and feedback, has been shown to contribute to improved performance of national diseases surveillance systems.  This section will describe how to routinely monitor and annually evaluate the performance of the surveillance system and specific disease or public health events control and prevention programs. The section will concentrate on the core surveillance functions described in the introduction section. The section will also describe how supervision and provision of feedback are key for the improvement of the surveillance and response systems.  Some of the benefits of monitoring, evaluating and supervision feedback of IDSR system include:  A.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Routine monitoring of IDSR system;  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Tracking progress of implementation of planned activities and ensuring that planned targets are achieved in a timely manner  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Tracking progress of improvements in targeted indicators of the quality and attributes of the system, such as timeliness of reporting and completeness of reporting  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Identifying problems in the system in order to institute corrective measures in a timely manner;  \\xad\\xa0\\xa0 Ensure that all implementers of the systems are held responsible and accountable for their defined activities.  \\xad\\xa0\\xa0 Other stakeholders can receive information on the performance of the surveillance system  Evaluation of IDSR system  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Ensure that the surveillance system meets the objectives for which it was formulated;  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Document the status of, and any change in the performance of the system;  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Provide evidence, based on which surveillance objectives, implementation strategy and planned activities can be modified;  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Enable planning of resource allocation;  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Provide explanations for achievements and failures in the system;  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Provide specific recommendations for improving the system.  C.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Providing feedback after supervision of \\xa0\\xa0IDSR system  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Reinforce health staff efforts to participate in the surveillance system  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Motivation for those who sent the data and hence increase compliance for reporting.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Increase quality of data from those who collect the data  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Enhances the planned public health action  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It will compliment planning for appropriate actions.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Strengthening of the communication and spirit of team working  Section 3 of Booklet 2 describes how each month, the health staffs responsible for surveillance at the health facility and at the district level review and analyse the data reported during the month. Conclusions are made about:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The timeliness and completeness of reporting from each level, and  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The quality of routine prevention and control activities taking place so that when problems are detected, districts respond with appropriate action.  The same information can also be used during supervisions to routinely monitor and annually evaluate:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The timeliness in reporting immediately-notifiable diseases, conditions or events  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Outbreak investigations and responses and  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Reporting of summary data on a routine basis.  When problems are detected in the surveillance and response system, action can be taken to strengthen the system. By giving feedback to the health workers for the corrections which have been identified, it is more likely that results will show the desired outcomes. For example, use the monthly monitoring data to do an evaluation at the end of the year. Questions to help evaluate include:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are surveillance objectives for existing activities being met?  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Was surveillance data used for taking public health action?  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Did surveillance, laboratory and response activities have an impact on the outcome of health events in the district?  8.1 Identify targets and indicators  Using indicators can be helpful in measuring the extent of achievement for a particular program or activity. Indicators\\xa0are signs of progress – they are used to determine whether the programme/intervention is on its way to achieving its objectives and goal. This achievement is then compared to overall recommended performance standard. Some disease specific surveillance indicators also exist and can be used to monitor quality of the surveillance system e.g. AFP and measles.  Indicators are also used to assess the performance of surveillance system whether it is reaching its targets and objectives. For example, a district may have a goal of reaching 100% completeness of reporting by a certain period. An indicator can be developed to measure the proportion or percentage of facilities that are reporting. This proportion is then compared with the desired goal or target, and can be used to evaluate progress and, therefore, the quality of the service or activity.  8.1.1 Use indicators in accordance with national goals and specific plans  Use indicators according to national goals and specific plans to improve IDSR activities in a district. Select the indicators that are most relevant to the district’s plan for improving surveillance this year and that will provide information that the district can use.  8.1.2 Select data for measuring the indicators  After you have selected relevant indicators, specify the numerator and the denominator. For example, if a district objective is for all health facilities to keep trend lines for selected priority diseases, the numerator and denominator are defined as follows:  Indicator:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The proportion of health facilities in the district that keep trend  lines for priority diseases.  Numerator:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The number of health facilities that keep trend lines for priority \\u2028diseases.  Denominator:\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The total number of health facilities in the district.  8.1.3 Ensure sources of data are available  Each level should make sure that the level it supervises has the following sources of data available. For example, the national level has data available from the district, and national level to conduct the required monitoring activities.

In the introduction section, core surveillance functions were described and you can refer to the table of core surveillance functions for each level. This sub-section will describe the key indicators at various levels as regard to the core functions. The core functions are described here briefly, but described in detail in Annexe 8C, whereby there are indicators for each core function (See Annexes 8A, 8B, 8D and 8E).  The core functions are;  (i)\\xa0 Identify cases and public health events  Case detection is the process of identifying cases and outbreaks. Case detection can be through the formal health system, private health systems or community structures. Case definitions and a functioning rumour verification system are vital for case and outbreak detection. Once a case has been identified, there is register (Outpatient or In-patient register, clinical cases register etc.) where these cases have to be recorded. In many countries, health workers use the registers to extract the IDSR priority diseases.  \\xa0Monitoring indicators should be established to monitor this core surveillance function. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  Examples of indicators could be  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of health facilities that have standardized registers for recording diseases. Further assessment could also be done to examine the validity and quality of information recorded as well as factors that affect the registration  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of health facilities using Standard Case Definitions (SCD) to identify IDSR priority diseases of cases.  (ii) Report Cases and Events  Reporting refers to the process by which surveillance data moves through the surveillance system from the point of generation to the next level.  It also refers to the process of reporting suspected and confirmed outbreaks as well as notifying under the IHR 2005 of PHEIC using the decision instrument mentioned in Section 2. Different reporting systems may be in existence depending on the type of data and information being reported, purpose and urgency of relaying the information and where the data/information is being reported. Timely submission of data is critical for prompt outbreak detection and response to prevent widespread outbreaks. Health facilities should therefore strive to submit reports on time as prescribed in the IDSR Technical guidelines Booklet 2, Section 2.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Examples of indicators for this core surveillance function include;  -\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of complete surveillance reports submitted on time to the district.  -\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of cases of diseases targeted for elimination, eradication and any other disease selected for case-based surveillance reported with case-based forms or line lists  (iii) Data analysis and interpretation  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Data analysis is the systematic process of examining data to generate relevant information for timely and appropriate public health action to be taken. Surveillance data should be analysed routinely and the information interpreted for use in public health actions. Capacity for routine data analysis and interpretation should be established and maintained for epidemiological as well as laboratory data  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Examples of indicators which can be used to monitor analysis include;  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of priority diseases for which a current line graph is available.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of districts that report laboratory data for diseases under surveillance  \\xa0(iv) Investigation and confirmation of suspected cases/outbreaks  Case/outbreak confirmation depends on the epidemiological and laboratory capacity for confirmation.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Capacity for case confirmation is enhanced through improved referral systems, networking and partnerships. This means having the capacity for appropriate specimen collection, packaging and transportation.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The existence of internal and external quality control mechanisms are important elements for case confirmation, which help to ensure the validity and reliability of test results.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Examples of indicators for monitoring this core function include  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of suspected outbreaks of epidemic prone disease notified to the \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 district level within 24 hours of crossing the epidemic threshold  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of investigated outbreaks with laboratory results  (v) Prepare  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Epidemic preparedness refers to the existing level of preparedness for potential epidemics and includes availability of preparedness plans, stockpiling, designation of isolation facilities, treatment units, setting aside of resources for outbreak response  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Examples of indicators which can be used to monitor preparedness include  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of health facilities with stock of key items (for example PPE, specimen collection kits, case-investigation forms, I.V fluids, treatment kits) that are important in response  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of districts with emergency preparedness and response plans  (vi) Respond  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Public health surveillance systems are only useful if they provide data for appropriate public health response and control. For an early warning system, the capacity to respond to detected outbreaks and emerging public health threats needs to be assessed. This can be done following a major outbreak response and containment to document the quality and impact of public health response and control.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Some examples of indicators for monitoring response include;  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of districts with functional multi-sectoral Health cluster and PHEMC for \\xa0emergency public health preparedness and response  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of districts with functional multi-sectoral District Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Teams (PHERRT).  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Case Fatality rate for the epidemic prone disease reported  (v) Provide Feedback  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Feedback is a process in which the effect or output of an action is returned (fed-back) to modify the next action. It is an important function of all surveillance systems. Item 8.5.2 of this section, describes well the types of feedback which can be used to improve performance of IDSR.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Some examples of indicators for feedback include:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of districts producing regular epidemiological bulletins  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of feedback bulletins/reports received from national levels (if you are evaluating feedback from national to district levels)  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Proportion of health facilities with at least one IDSR technical support supervision visit in the previous quarter.  \\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0NOTE: While all indicators for the IDSR core functions are important, WHO AFRO will measure the overall performance of core functions of IDSR in the countries, by using 14 key performance indicators described in Annex 8J. \\u2029\\xa0 \\ufdd1\\u2029\\xa0 8.3 Monitor the quality of IDSR activities at district Level  The quality of the surveillance system is defined by attributes such as:  i.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 completeness,  ii.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 timeliness,  iii.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 usefulness,  iv.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 sensitivity,  v.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 positive predictive value (PPV),  vi.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 specificity,  vii.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 representativeness,  viii.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 simplicity,  ix.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 flexibility,  x.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 acceptability,  xi.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 reliability.  Periodically the quality of the surveillance system should be assessed based on these attributes. Surveillance attributes can be evaluated using quantitative and qualitative methods. The updated Morbidity Mortality Weekly Report (MMWR), updated guidelines for evaluating public health surveillance systems produced by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the framework for evaluating public health surveillance systems for early detection of outbreaks are some of the tools which can be used to evaluate comprehensively surveillance systems (CDC, 2001). Countries, which already have a Field Epidemiology Training Programs (FETP) or equivalent applied epidemiology program, should use residents to assist in evaluation of the surveillance and response systems of IDSR and other disease surveillance systems.  8.3.1 Monitoring the timeliness and completeness of monthly reporting  An important indicator of a quality reporting system is the timeliness and completeness of reporting at each level. When reports are sent and received on time, the possibility of detecting a problem and conducting a prompt and effective response is greater. If they are incomplete, then the information cannot describe the problem. If reports are late, or are not submitted, the aggregated information for the district (or other administrative area) will not be accurate. Outbreaks can go undetected, and other opportunities to respond to public health problems will be missed.  8.3.1.1 Timeliness  The single most important measure of timeliness is whether data are submitted in time to begin investigations and implement control measures. Timeliness of reporting should be measured against standards developed by each country in accordance with the timelines set by WHO AFRO. Important aspects of timelines of reporting in a communicable disease surveillance system include:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 timeliness of immediate notification, i.e. within 24 hours  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 timeliness of weekly reporting  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 timeliness of monthly reporting  (i)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Monitor detection and notification of immediately reportable diseases or events  Monitor how well the system is able to detect immediately notifiable diseases or events. Monitor the interval between the onset of the first known case and when the case was seen in the health facility. If this interval is too long, it will seriously affect the health outcome of individual patients and will alter the spread of the outbreak.  Other intervals to monitor for detection of immediately reportable diseases include monitoring reporting from the community to the health facility and to the district (within 24 hours of onset of illness), from the health facility to the district (within 24 hours) and from the time the threshold is reached to a concrete response (within 48 hours).  (ii)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Timeliness of weekly and monthly reporting  If you routinely record and review the dates on which reports are received, the effectiveness of the system can be assessed easily each month during the analysis of routine and case-based data. You can use a monitoring tool such as the one in Annex 8F to monitor timeliness in your district. For example, use the record of reports received to:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Measure how many reporting units submitted reports for a given week/ month against the number of units expected to report  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Identify which reporting units have reported  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Measure how many monthly reports were timely. Ensure deadlines are given for  each level to enable effective monitoring.  8.2.1.2 Completeness  Completeness in surveillance can have varying dimensions and may include the following:  (i)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Completeness of reporting sites submitting surveillance forms:  Completeness of reporting sites refers to the proportion of reporting sites that submitted the surveillance report irrespective of the time when the report was submitted. Computing completeness of reporting sites for each of the surveillance reports can:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 provide a trend analysis on completeness of reporting for each of the surveillance reports over a period of time; and assist in identifying how each site is performing  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 It can also further trigger investigation for reasons for poor performances and possibly help to identify solutions to correct poor performance.  (ii)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Completeness of case reporting  Completeness of case reporting refers to the match between the number of cases reported and the actual number of cases. This can be obtained by comparing the number of the reportable conditions reported to the next higher level over a period with the number of cases recorded in the patient register over the same period.  (iii)\\xa0 Completeness of surveillance data  Completeness of surveillance data is the match between the expected data requirement and what is reported. The following questions are useful in determining completeness of surveillance data and its implications on public health actions.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Are all the data on each of the required variables in a surveillance form collected, registered, validated and compiled?  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If not, which variables are not routinely collected and what is the problem with their collection?  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What is the implication of the missing data on the quality of the surveillance data?  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 How can this problem be resolved?  8.3.1.3 Identify problems and take action  If the monitoring information shows that a health facility or other reporting unit has not provided a report, or if the report is not on time, contact the surveillance focal point at the facility. Work with the designated staff to identify what has caused the problem and develop solutions together (for example, find out if a reliable supply of forms or other reporting method such as text messaging or radiophone is available). Explain to the facility staff the benefits of collecting good quality data and reporting it in a timely manner. For example, this can help them to detect outbreaks, improves medicines and supplies forecasting, and improves overall health facility management.  Additionally, ask if a new staff person has started at the facility and is yet to receive orientation on the procedure for reporting. Or find out if health facility staff receives feedback about case reports they have generated and that there are resources available to take action as a result of the information.  Make plans with the reporting unit to find solutions for improving the situation. Explain that, when information is complete, the district can assist health staff more efficiently with planning responses and carrying them out. For example, if lack of supplies is a problem, the district can use the reporting information to advocate with higher levels in the system.  8.3.1.4 Report timeliness and completeness to other levels  When routine reports or line-listed records of the number of cases are sent to the district or national level, also send the necessary data for timeliness and completeness. This will help the other levels understand the situation more clearly and evaluate the quality of the data that is being sent. For example, if the report to the national level states that two cases of measles were detected during the month, it should also include information about the number of health facilities that have reported. It will make a difference to the other levels when they evaluate the information if the 2 cases occurred with only 20% rather than 100% of the units reporting.  8.3.2 Monitoring other attributes for assessing the quality of the IDSR system  Some other key important attributes are summarized in the table below and can be used to assess the quality of surveillance system. These attributes should be used to assess the quality of surveillance systems during periodic evaluation assessments (Table 8.2). Readers are referred to the updated framework for evaluating surveillance systems for a complete list of attributes.  Table 8.2: Summary of other attributes for assessing quality of surveillance system  Attribute \\ufdd0Definition \\ufdd0Examples of some questions to assist in assessment \\ufdd0Usefulness \\ufdd0Describes if the surveillance system has been able to contribute to the prevention and control initiatives or has been useful in contribution to the performance measures \\u2029e.g. Usefulness of surveillance data in an early warning system \\ufdd0Is the system e.g., the early warning system able to detect outbreaks early? \\u2029\\xa0 \\u2029Example: A useful system over time must demonstrate that a certain intervention which has been instituted and has worked.

Updated guideline for evaluating public health surveillance systems. MMWR: 50 (RR-13); 1-35.  8.4 Monitor the quality of surveillance activities at community level\\xa0  8.4.1 Monitoring events from community based surveillance  Monitoring CBS system is equally important as monitoring health facility, districts and national level. Community health workers/community focal persons/volunteers involved in the system must understand the benefit of the system, and that their input is valued and can assist in improvement or adaptation of the system to work better for the community.  Qualitative feedback from volunteers and the community is an essential part of contextualizing and understanding quantitative CBS data. A system should be in place from the beginning to capture community and volunteers’ feedback and this may involve one or more of the following approaches;  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Open and regular community meetings where all issues are noted and acted upon.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Focus group discussions with volunteers and/or community leaders.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Suggestions and complaints box(es) for use in the community.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Appointment of a community representative(s) to gather feedback and complaints.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Feedback platforms on mobile phones can be used by the community volunteers to give feedback  There should also be community-driven data analysis and monitoring, whereby the community are supported to undertake their own data analysis. Community can be provided with basic material to record the type of occurrences they report and the resulting actions, as well as recording outbreaks or events that occurred but did not trigger an alert so that triggers can be adjusted. Some performance indicators listed below (table 8.3), are examples of indicators for community based surveillance.

Supervision is not an inspection. Rather, good supportive supervision aims to sustain good quality services rather than finding things that are wrong.  In a good supportive supervision system, supervisors and health staffs work together to review progress, identify problems, decide what has caused the problem and develop feasible solutions.  (a)\\xa0\\xa0 Ensure availability of job descriptions and Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) for surveillance staff  Job descriptions and SOPs are the basis for conducting supervision and assessing performance. Review the job descriptions and SOPs of health staff who have a role in the surveillance and response system. Make sure that the job description states:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The surveillance tasks to perform  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 To whom the staff person reports  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Have define scope of work and also ensure that SOPs are adhered to in practice  (b)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Prepare a supervision plan  Include surveillance and response targets in the overall plan for supervision in your district. For example:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Decide how often to monitor health staff performance. For example, a district may decide to conduct a supervisory visit at least 4 times a year for each health facility. In some countries, depending on resources, supervisory visits take place more often (monthly, for example).  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Ask health facility supervisors to make a schedule of the supervision they will conduct over the next year in their own facilities and to any community sites that report to the facility.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Make sure that transport is available for supervision and for surveillance activities that require transportation. For example, coordinate travel or logistics for surveillance supervisory visits with visits made by other programs or activities.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Include other reporting sites in supervision of district surveillance activities such as private health centres, other clinics [schools, uniformed forces], medical centres and community reporting sites in the overall plan.  (c)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Use a supervisory checklist  Each health facility has unique problems and priorities that require specific problem solving and corrections. To maintain the positive motivation of the health facility staff for making the improvements, consider developing a graduated checklist to guide the supervisory visit. The items listed in a graduated checklist (such as the one in Annex 8G) are some of the examples of achievements that a health facility can be evaluated on. Always refer to Annexes (8A-8F) and look for additional examples to evaluate for each core surveillance function at the health facility level.\\xa0 For example, when the facility has achieved one objective (using standard case definitions consistently, for example), work with health facility staff to include the next indicator or item for monitoring performance such as using thresholds for action. Revise the supervisory checklist accordingly. Use it during future visits to help health staff monitor their activities and progress towards an improved system.  During the visit, use a checklist to monitor how well health staffs are carrying out the recommended surveillance functions. For example, a district surveillance officer visiting a health facility for a supervisory visit should verify the following:  Identify and\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Check the health facility register to see if the  register cases\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 case diagnoses correspond to the recommended case definition.  Check the register to see if all the columns are filled out correctly.  Confirm cases\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Compare the laboratory records for priority diseases with the  number of cases seen in the clinic for the same period of time. For example, compare the number of positive malaria slides with the reported number of hospitalized malaria cases.  Reporting\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Ask to see copies of the most recent reports for the most recent  reporting period. Compare the number of cases of priority diseases that were reported with the number recorded in the register.  Check the date on which the case report was sent against the date recommended for sending the report.  Check the reports to make sure they are complete and accurate.  Review and\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Verify that trend lines are prepared and kept up-to-date for  analyse data\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 priority diseases.  Verify if they have graphs displayed on the boards or the electronic health facility data in your district. Look to see if the trend lines for selected diseases are up to date.  Preparedness\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Look at the stocks of emergency drugs, supplies and PPE to be sure there is an adequate supply.  Note: A sample supervisory checklist is in Annex 8G at the end of this section. Additionally, Annexes 8A-8F, describes details of core surveillance functions at health facility level and can be used for guidance in supervision of the health facility. The questions to be answered during the supervisory visit can be adapted or modified to meet the specific concerns and extent of progress towards an integrated surveillance system within the health facility.  (d)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Conduct supervisory visit  Conduct regularly scheduled supervision at all levels (national to districts; district to health facility; health facility to community) to ensure that:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Appropriate supplies (e.g. forms, job aids) and required standard case definitions/ guidelines are available.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Public Health staff knows how to identify and use standard case definitions to record suspected cases of priority diseases seen in their health facility.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Priority diseases are recorded in the case register according to the case definition.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Some data are analysed in the health facility to identify thresholds to take action both for routinely reported priority diseases (disease of public health importance) and case-based diseases (epidemic-prone diseases, and diseases targeted for eradication or elimination).  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Reported cases of diseases, conditions, or events for which a single case is a suspected outbreak or public health emergency are investigated promptly (for example a single confirmed case of cholera or polio, maternal death, MDR/XDR TB).  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Response takes place when outbreaks or other public health events are confirmed, or when problems are identified in routine reporting.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Response actions are monitored and action is taken by the health facility to improve surveillance and readiness for outbreak response.  Make sure during the visit to:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Provide feedback to health staff. Let the health staff knows what is working and what is not working. Also give feedback on how the data reported previously was used to detect outbreaks and take action to reduce illness, mortality and disability in the district. If improvements are needed, discuss solutions with the staff.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Provide on-the-job training as needed if a problem is identified. For example, during a review of the analysis workbook, the supervisor noted that case fatality rates were not calculated correctly. The supervisor met with the health staffs who do the calculation and reviewed the steps for calculating the rate with the staff.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Follow up on any request for assistance such as for emergency response equipment or supplies.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 If a solution to a pre-existing problem was identified in a previous visit, check to see how well the solution has been implemented. Find out if problems are still occurring and modify the solution if necessary.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Ensure that both the supervisor and supervisee sign the supervision reports and also provide dates when the supervision was done. \\u2028 (e)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Write a report of the supervisory visit  Put in the report achievements that were identified during the visit. Also state the follow-up actions that were planned with the health staff and any requests for additional resources, funds or special problems.  (f)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Use supervisory visits to improve surveillance activities in the district  Visits of surveillance supervisors are good opportunities to discuss and improve disease control in your district. For example, if a national malaria control person visits the district, you may utilise their visit to discuss why the inpatient malaria deaths have not been declining. You can ask about additional ideas or resources that the malaria control program can provide.  8.5.2 Feedback  In most cases, health facilities and districts reliably report surveillance data to the next level as required. When the district or national managers receive data, they should respond to the health facilities that reported it. The purpose of the feedback is to reinforce health workers’ effort to participate in the surveillance system. Another purpose is to raise awareness about certain diseases and any achievements of disease control and prevention projects in the area. Feedback is classified as supportive when it reinforces and acknowledges good performance and corrective when a change in behaviour and improvement is required. It also strengthens the communication and spirit of team working. The feedback should be both vertical and horizontal targeting at different audiences as provided by different levels in the health system. Effective feedback should be;  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Specific to assure the recipient understands the subject of the feedback  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Should be based on the report submitted or the actual events and activities observed in the field  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Be given as soon as feasible after receiving the report or field visit, so that the recipient will remember the activities that should be either sustained or corrected  If the facility does not receive information from the next level about how the data were used or what the data meant, health staff may think that their reporting is not important. As a result, future reporting may not be as reliable because health staff will not know if the information they sent to other levels was important or necessary. They will have a good understanding of the health situation at their own level, but they will not have the information they need for characterizing the situation at a district or national level. At the community level, communication includes building relationships, communicate and coordination with other community key informants, resource persons and existing formal and informal networks for information dissemination and reporting.  Feedback may be written, such as a monthly newsletter/bulletin, emails, WhatsApp, SMS or periodic official information like publications or it may be given verbally through telephone call or periodic meetings. Although this section focuses on district level feedback, this can also be applied in health facility and national levels. Feedback may also be given during supportive supervision carried out by Districts to health facilities, to Districts or National to districts. The supervision can be on performance of health programs and feedback can be provided during these visits.  (a)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Develop and disseminate routine epidemiological bulletins  Feedback should also be given periodically of IDSR reportable diseases/conditions, and this can be through weekly, monthly or quarterly epidemiological bulletins. The bulletins provide information on disease patterns and achievement of program objectives in the country. They are usually brief and are important for reaching policy makers, legislators, development partners, program technical staff and stakeholders. As a minimum, they contain:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A summary table with the number of reported cases and deaths to date for each priority disease  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A commentary or message on a given disease or topic  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Any relevant social, economic or cultural information or data on the context that can lead to the creation of real intelligence regarding an event. Annex 8H shows examples of an epidemiological bulletin \\u2028 (b) Develop information summary sheets  An information summary sheet is a report that presents data and its interpretation in a table or other graphic format. For example:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 At a staff meeting, or during a supervisory visit, give a verbal report or comment about the data that were reported by the health facility during a given period.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Display the data in a simple table. Sit with the health staff and show them the data. Talk together about the likely conclusions that can be drawn. Consider conclusions not only for the health facility, but also for the district as a whole.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Prepare a single sheet with a simple table that shows how the data reported for this period are different from the data reported for some other period or target population. For example, show the number of cases of diarrhoea with dehydration in children less than 5 years of age from the same period last year. Compare them with a corresponding period this year, after a safe water project was implemented in a high-risk area, for example, use the summary sheets to support requests made to higher levels for additional funds, supplies and resources.  (c) Develop district newsletters  The purpose of a district newsletter is to provide shorter updates than those provided in a more detailed feedback bulletin. The district newsletter is useful for informing and motivating health staff. The target audience for a newsletter could be health staff in the district. The newsletter can be 2 to 4 pages long and produced simply with a computer entered text.  Examples of articles that could be carried in a newsletter are:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Summary of national or district data for a given priority disease  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Report of progress towards a specific public health target  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Report of a specific achievement towards public health by an individual health  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 worker \\xa0\\xa0  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 or a group of health workers  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Description of special events or activities (for example, a change in market day)  8.6 Evaluate effectiveness of the performance of IDSR strategy  The purpose of evaluation of a surveillance system is to assess the effectiveness of the system and response system in terms of timeliness, quality of data, preparedness, case management, overall performance and using the indicators to identify gaps or areas that could be strengthened. A comprehensive evaluation should thus include the surveillance system and if already available the IDSR Implementation Plan. The evaluation of the surveillance system should:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Show to what extent the desired outputs and outcomes are achieved;  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Provide explanations for achievements, disparities and failures;  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Document the quality of system and demonstrate any changes in its performance;  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Demonstrate the extent to which the overall surveillance objectives are achieved.  Depending on the development status of surveillance in a district, select indicators for evaluation that will provide information that relates to the district’s priorities and objectives for the year.  If there is already an IDSR implementation plan with clearly defined objectives, then it is appropriate to conduct mid-term and end-of-term evaluations. Otherwise surveillance systems should be evaluated every 2, 3 or 5 years.  Key steps in evaluation include:  8.6.1 Define your objectives  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Objectives should be simple, measurable, attainable, realistic, and time-bound (SMART).  8.6.2 Development of evaluation indicators  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Indicators should be identified for each of the evaluation objectives, and should be harmonized as much as possible with the monitoring indicators.  8.6.3 Development of evaluation methods and tools  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Based on these indicators, an evaluation protocol should be developed describing how the evaluation will be conducted, methods, target group, data sources, data collection methods, and plan for data analysis and utilization  8.6.4 Identify people to conduct the evaluation  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Determine who will be the evaluators; people within the districts, people outside the district, or a mixture of people including and partners/donors. Depending on the scope of the evaluation, its purpose and the available resources, a decision should be made during the planning stage on who should undertake them.  To ensure objectivity and transparency during the evaluation process, a blend of self-internal evaluations and external evaluations should be conducted periodically.  8.6.5 Conduct the evaluation  8.6.5.1 Compile and organize monitoring data and other results  The district health office should summarize the surveillance data received from all health facilities in the catchment area, and submit the compiled report to the national level as appropriate. The submission of the report should not be delayed until reports from all health facilities are received. Submit all reports received on time. Late reports may be submitted when they arrive. Follow up with health facilities who did not report or who consistently provide late reports.  Help the health facility to solve any problems that prevent them from submitting their summary reports on time. Provide feedback to health facilities about the indicator results on a regular basis. Feedback is a positive tool for motivating health staff to provide information on time and contribute to the national reporting system.  The national level should compile the surveillance data received from all the districts. It national level should look for epidemics that were not identified by the districts. Follow up with areas where reporting continues to be unreliable or does not happen at all. Support the districts in providing assistance to the health facilities when they evaluate the measurements and take action to improve the situation. Provide feedback to each of the levels (national, district, health facility and community).  Use a monitoring chart such as the one on the next page to monitor performance of the indicators at your level. Share these results with the staff in your catchment level. Acknowledge successes and help health staff to maintain the positive progress. When problems occur, talk together about what is causing the problem and how it can be solved. Seek assistance of the next level as needed for obtaining additional help or resources.  Gather data from several sources. For example:  o\\xa0\\xa0 Review the objectives for the year listed in the district’s annual plan for improving surveillance and response.  o\\xa0\\xa0 Gather the monthly summaries of cases and deaths reported to the district, spot maps, and other analysis results performed by the district.  o\\xa0\\xa0 Collect any results from special surveys or studies that were done in the district over the previous year.  o\\xa0\\xa0 Include case investigation forms and reports of outbreak response activities that took place in the district.  o\\xa0\\xa0 Gather summary information from the community and also from health staff  8.6.5.2 Analyse data  As you evaluate the summary data for the year, some items to decide on are:  o\\xa0\\xa0 Were the reports complete, on time and accurate?  o\\xa0\\xa0 What were significant changes in disease or event trends during the year? If an increase occurred, was the problem identified?  o\\xa0\\xa0 If additional cases are still occurring, why are they occurring? Where are they occurring?  o\\xa0\\xa0 Were appropriate and timely actions taken in response to the surveillance data?  o\\xa0\\xa0 Were supervisory visits conducted as planned and follow up tasks carried out as planned?  o\\xa0\\xa0 Did the community feel that response activities were successful?  o\\xa0\\xa0 Were any actions taken to address health staff requests or suggestions about services or surveillance?  o\\xa0\\xa0 Were appropriate measures taken to prevent similar events?  8.6.5.3 Identify problems and their causes  If problems occurred, and the district did not meet an expected target, or reach a desired level of performance with any indicator, find out what caused the difference between what was planned and what actually occurred. If a problem is identified, talk with the district team and health facility staff to find out the possible causes of the problem.  8.6.6 Update plans for improvements to the IDSR system  Include in the district plan successful activities that should continue. Also include feasible solutions selected as a result of analysis of the year’s annual evaluation. Plan to implement the solution. For example:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 State the new activity and its objectives.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Specify the personnel who will carry out the activity.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Estimate the cost of the activity (if any).  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Develop a timetable for the activity. Define the sequence of activities in logical order.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Specify the logistics for the new activity (equipment, personnel, transportation, resource allocation).  8.6.7 Provide feedback to health facilities about the evaluation  Provide a report and give feedback to health facilities and others in the district about the results of the evaluation activity. Mention in the feedback report:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What the objectives were for the year.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What was actually achieved  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 What were likely reasons for any differences between what was planned and what \\xa0\\xa0  \\xa0\\xa0 was achieved.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Recommended solutions and prioritized activities for improving \\xa0\\xa0  \\xa0\\xa0 surveillance and response in the district.  8.7 Annexes to section 8  Annex 8A: \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 IDSR core

WHO/CDS/EPR/LYO/2006.1  TECHNICAL GUIDELINES FOR INTEGRATED DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE IN MALAWI  THIRD EDITION  MODULE 9:\\xa0 ELECTRONIC INTEGRATED DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE (eIDSR)  DECEMBER 2020 \\u2028 MODULE 9: ELECTRONIC INTEGRATED DISEASE SURVEILLANCE AND RESPONSE (eIDSR)  9.0 Electronic IDSR (eIDSR)  Electronic IDSR (eIDSR) is the system put in place by the Ministry of Health to use different sets of electronic tools, digital solutions, human capacity and processes according to the principles of IDSR to facilitate surveillance functions for public health monitoring and diseases prevention, prediction, detection, reporting and response. It is based on;  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Standardised interoperable and interconnected information systems administered within the national context.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Rapid collection, analysis, reporting and use of disease/events data in real-time for appropriate public health action.  The use of paper-based tools for implementation of IDSR has been an instrumental strategy for strengthening public health surveillance in the African region since IDSR was adopted in 1998. With the adoption of the International Health Regulations IHR (2005), which requires countries to strengthen capacity for disease surveillance and response, application of electronic tools to enhance real-time surveillance can improve timeliness of outbreak detection.  In recent years, technological and analytical innovations have emerged as an approach which can be used to facilitate rapid transmission of public health surveillance information, consequently aiding timely detection of and response to outbreaks and other public health events. The application of e-tools in the health sector has the potential to provide real-time validated data for public health surveillance, investigation and prompt outbreak response. eIDSR provides new opportunities for acceleration of the achievement of the IHR (2005) core capacities. \\u2028 9.1 eIDSR in the context of Malawi  Malawi started the exploration and piloting of potential solution for eIDSR in 2015. Based on the second eIDSR (Argus) pilot and recent study results19, the country adopted the DHIS2 as the digital platform to facilitate the eIDSR functionalities with the One Health approach. The Ministry of Health started developing the national eIDSR central data system, namely One Health Surveillance Platform (OHSP) in 2019, using DHIS2 technology. The OHSP/DHIS2 was designed and developed in a way to be able to interoperate with the national HMIS/DHIS2 instance for needed surveillance data exchange. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the OHSP was leveraged to respond to the COVID-19 surveillance needs. The OHSP was rapidly customized and roll-out countrywide with supports from multiple partners in 2020. Acknowledging the needs of moving IDSR from paper system to digital solution, the ministry is continuing the OHSP enhancement and development work in the years to come.  9.2 eIDSR in the context of Health Management Information Systems (HMIS)  HMIS is used by Malawi to facilitate routine collection of data to support planning, management and decision-making in the health service provision. HMIS routinely collect data about diseases, events and conditions, as well as other administrative and service provision data. The primary source of the data is the health facility Outpatient Department (OPD) or Inpatient Department (IPD) register. The Primary electronic platform of HMIS in Malawi is DHIS2. This open source platform is mostly used in low and middle-income countries.  In both HMIS and eIDSR, the source data are derived from the health facility OPD, IPD or Community Health register. eIDSR is an enabling platform for reporting in real time for IDSR priority diseases.\\xa0 In the eIDSR platform, there is an active and timely means of collection of data on IDSR priority diseases, and conditions which are extracted from either OPD or IPD registers including patients’ folders, and they are reported immediately or weekly or monthly. HMIS emphasizes on completeness of aggregate reports whereas the OHSP/eIDSR focusses on timeliness and it requires a lot of data transactions while concentrating on individual level data which requires confidentiality. Both systems need to be interoperable as some analysis requires availability of data from both systems. For instance, calculation of prevalence of Diarrhoea cases in Under 5 years old children indicator requires population data which is captured in HMIS.  9.3 eIDSR in the context of eHealth  In 2013, the African region adopted an eHealth resolution (AFR/RC60/R3) to address the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) for health and health-related fields, including disease surveillance. In Malawi, the Ministry of Health instituted the Digital Health Division to coordinate and handle all issues related to health information systems including the development of the eHealth strategy and appropriate governance mechanisms. eHealth encompasses a range of services and systems, including;  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 health and medical informatics – e.g. TB/ART EMR, Master Health Facility Registry, Early Infant Diagnosis/ Viral load Laboratory Information Management System, One Health Surveillance Platform. - OHSP, etc.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 tele-health, which means transmission of health related services or information over the telecommunications infrastructure e.g. Chipatala Cha Pa Foni – CCPF, COVID19 Unstructured Supplementary Service Data – USSD 929 service.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 e-learning which means utilizing technologies to access education outside of the traditional classroom e.g. TranSMART.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 m-health which is a general term for use of mobile phone and other wireless technologies in medical health e.g. Integrated Supportive Supervision – ISS, COVID19 WhatsApp chart box, RapidPro SMS.  Member states echoed the same sentiment in the recent 71st World Health Assembly and unanimously agreed that digital health solutions should complement and enhance existing health service delivery models. Subsequently, they adopted the new resolution on Digital health which underscores the importance of nationally-supported digital health strategies, supporting and investing in the digital health enabling environment (including policy, standards, capacity, interoperability, privacy and security, and more), and transitioning to sustainability and government ownership.\\xa0  Digital health or sometimes called eHealth provides cost-effective and secure use of ICTs in health and health-related fields. Digital health, as defined by the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, is an umbrella term that encompasses all concepts and activities at the intersection of health and information and communications technologies (ICTs). This includes the delivery of health information, using ICTs to improve public health services, and using health information systems to capture, store, manage or transmit information on patient health or health facility activities.\\xa0 ICTs are defined as tools that facilitate communication and the processing and transmission of information by electronic means and these encompass a full range of tools like radio and television to telephones (fixed and mobile), computers, and the Internet.  eIDSR, which is part of eHealth, is one of the essential innovations for fulfilment of the regional committee recommendations on use of information technology, which is core in the achievement of IHR (2005) requirements by countries. Standardization of electronic tools and sustained infrastructure across the region will promote easy generation and sharing of country and regional profiles of priority diseases, conditions and events.  9.4 Rationale of eIDSR  The limitations with the traditional approach of IDSR data collection and transmission in Malawi, are attributed to the fact that manual procedures and paper methods are used to collect and transmit data. Submitting and transmitting the data on time is a challenge, as health workers have to travel long distances on difficult terrains to submit their files. This leads to delays in getting information on time for action, especially if there is a suspected outbreak. Some of the challenges associated with the paper system include scarcity of paper forms leading to less reporting of cases, huge costs of transporting the paper forms to Health Facilities where the information is captured in an electronic system.  With advancement of the eIDSR enabler in Malawi, i.e. increased coverage of mobile networks, availability of eIDSR gadgets in most of our communities, health facilities are now equipped with difference sources of electricity (including solar power), the Ministry of Health has managed to scale up the One Health Surveillance Platform across the country. The eIDSR - OHSP system aims at facilitating the work of every staff member in a health system by improving disease surveillance using electronic tools and hence strengthening surveillance and response capacities. In a long term this will reduce morbidity and mortality from epidemic prone diseases as well as other public health events.  eIDSR is thus likely to improve the following;  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Timeliness and completeness of reporting  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Early detection, investigation, and response to outbreak or public health events  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Reduction in manual data entry that is prone to errors  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Systematic information sharing across levels and sectors  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Combining data streams  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Data analytics, analysis and use  Recently, there have been various supporting initiatives and resolutions, regionally and globally which have recognized the potential of digital technologies, to advance the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), and in particular to support health systems in all countries in health promotion and disease prevention. The eIDSR is hence developed to reflect the following recently adopted overarching frameworks:  1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response ((AFR/RC/48.8)\\xa0  2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 International Health Regulations (2005) (WHA58.3)  3.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Regional Strategy for Health Security and emergencies strategy (AFRO/RC66/6)  4.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 eHealth resolution and decision (WHA58.28)  5.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Digital health (WHA71.7)  9.5 Benefits of eIDSR  The eIDSR provides real-time information for immediate action. The potential benefits of eIDSR include:  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Early alert and detection  With eIDSR, the speed of outbreak detection can be improved as information may be more rapidly captured, and in some cases, the time and place of an outbreak can be predicted with varying degrees of accuracy enabling opportunities for prevention and control (Refer to a study done by CDC. 2008b. Potential effects of electronic laboratory reporting on improving timeliness of infectious disease notification—Florida, 2002–2006.\\xa0Morbidity and Mortality Weekly\\xa0Report\\xa057(49):1325–1328.\\xa0  http://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5749a2.htm)  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Timely reporting  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 eIDSR tools allow rapid and timely transmission of data from lower primary reporting units to subsequent higher levels to enable appropriate public health action  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Standardization of data  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Standardization of tools in eIDSR system enables data gathering to be consistent and complete to more easily facilitate data exchange and comparison across health facilities  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Better data transmission and management including storage  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A major challenge of paper based is a need to compile reports from various sources and provide these to higher level offices at regular intervals and to different administrative levels.\\xa0 Moreover, data storage and transport can be difficult, and there is a risk of data damage and loss.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 With eIDSR there is faster data transmission, and moreover, data are also organized into a format that is more accessible for use and interpretation.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Interoperability and sharing of data  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 eIDSR provides an opportunity for exchange and use of information across entities, especially if the standards and workflow have been well developed for the eIDSR system to allow interoperability with other information systems.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Automated transmission, analyses and improved quality data  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Paper based reporting approach runs the risk of omitting valuable information when reporting to higher administrative levels.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 eIDSR reduces the number of data entry errors and facilitate automated data analysis saving considerable effort for health staff.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Ultimately contribute towards good response, better monitoring and evaluation  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 eIDSR provides a platform for data storage and automatic analysis across the health facilities for better monitoring and evaluation of various public health interventions.  (Studies done by Valenciano et al, 2003 and 2003; Pinto el al 2005 which demonstrated that the simple advance of a computerised reporting system using country-identified thresholds for priority diseases did show improvements in monitoring trends and predicting outbreaks in a matter of weeks’ post-implementation)  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Reduces cost  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 eIDSR leads to early detection of disease outbreaks, which in effect, can contribute to the overall cost reduction associated with management of these outbreaks.  9.6 Key guiding principles in establishing eIDSR and progress in Malawi  Based on the WHO recommendation, the following are key guiding principles in the establishment of eIDSR;  · \\xa0\\xa0Use of existing infrastructure: When possible, eIDSR should be built on existing framework and systems, such as paper-based IDSR, HMIS, DHIS2, etc. This enables easy adaptability by the implementers, and promotes smooth transitions. If there is already an existing infrastructure, eIDSR introduction may possibly not require major customization which might be costly.\\xa0 In Malawi, the existing paper-based IDSR, HMIS/DHIS2 instance, community mobile applications are all leveraged and converge into the OHSP/DHIS2 as the main digital infrastructure during the COVID-19 pandemic and for the future. The existing infrastructure is enabling the further development and implementation of the eIDSR system in country.  · \\xa0\\xa0Standardization: Standardization of data and electronic tools will promote uniformity in data collection and aggregation. Standardization promotes comparison between the various levels of the health systems, and between countries. The eIDSR system components in Malawi are all aligned with the national standardized paper forms, i.e. Health Declaration Form at the POE, IDSR CBS reporting form, contact tracing form, etc.\\xa0  · \\xa0\\xa0Integration: IDSR is built on the in premise of integration. eIDSR should therefore be implemented in the spirit of integration. This could entail integration of the various data sources and information system from other health programs (e.g. malaria, EPI, cancer registry, non-communicable diseases etc.) into a common platform or data warehouse. The Malawi’s eIDSR OHSP system is the main data warehouse to store all IDSR related surveillance data and aiming to be fully integrated with different surveillance systems/data source.  ·\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Interoperability- is the ability of different health information systems to work together within and across organizational boundaries to exchange data and use the information that has been exchanged. It is important that the standards and workflow that the eIDSR developers developed, should easily be interoperable with other information systems. The Ministry of Health through relevant digital health development, adopted the open Health Information Exchange (OpenHIE) framework for interoperability and this has resulted in development of the interoperability layer and its enabling components or registries. Through the interoperability layer different systems are now able to exchange surveillance data into the One Health Surveillance Platform as the main data warehouse for IDSR related data.  · \\xa0\\xa0Multi-sectoral Collaboration: It is essential to collaborate with stakeholders, such as telecom companies. Such collaboration could be in form of wavers, corporate social responsibility, and partial tax holidays etc. Effective collaboration could accelerate the roll out and coverage of eIDSR. Collaboration with other sectors like animal and environment is also key as this will facilitate efficient utilization of scarce resources, effective and prompt leveraging of various sectors capabilities for better disease prevention and control. In Malawi, the eIDSR OHSP system was designed to incorporate with animal and environment health surveillance data. The eIDSR taskforce is continuing the multi-sectoral collaboration work with relevant governmental sectors.\\xa0  · \\xa0\\xa0Near real-time approach: Every effort should be made to ensure provision of near real-time transfer of information about events incorporated into the design and implementation of eIDSR. This should be a long-term goal and countries will have to start slowly with planning and developing in phases. In Malawi, the Government Wide Area Network (GWAN), telecommunication service providers (i.e. TNM and Airtel), internet service providers (ISP)) are leveraged to provide eIDSR needed connectivity service. The Malawi Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA) is engaged by the MOH to facilitate the relevant communication service for eIDSR. The aim for the country is to enable the nearly real-time surveillance from all levels of health services delivery.  · \\xa0\\xa0One Health: The One Health approach offers an innovative approach where various disciplines work together to address health at the human-animal-environment interface. In view of the fact that the majority of emerging and re-emerging infections are often zoonosis and responsible for large outbreaks in recent times, maintaining a focus on diseases that affect both humans and animals is a worthwhile investment. MOH is exploring potential technology solutions (i.e. mobile application, EMR automate disease surveillance, syndromic surveillance, drone technology, etc.) to reach the One Health surveillance goal.  · \\xa0\\xa0Data security: Protection of health information is essential in every health information system. Security of data will ensure that information is only accessible by authorized personnel, who need to take action. It also promotes ethical handling of data. Caution should be taken to ensure there are processes for patient privacy. The eIDSR data security and protection protocols of Malawi is following the MOH digital health, HIS policy and relevant government laws to ensure highest standard of protection is implemented.  · \\xa0\\xa0User-friendly system: The system should ideally be simple enough to be used by staff at all levels. It should be easy to log on, input and receive information. The system should also be flexible to adapt to change of disease and events profiles over time. In Malawi, the eIDSR taskforce is developing the system with agile and user-centred design principle. User feedbacks are regular collected and the development team together with the partners swiftly respond to the user needs to provide most user friendly interface and work flow.  9.7 eIDSR development and implementation Process in Malawi  Developing an eIDSR system should be planned carefully with the involvement of all relevant stakeholders. The system should fit the capabilities and needs of the country, and a plan for securing resources should be developed prior to initiating eIDSR.  The process of developing and implementing eIDSR in Malawi are shown below. The Ministry of Health is motivated to ensure the embarkation on eIDSR, by weighing the costs and benefits and also assessing the feasibility of eIDSR options in Malawi.  9.7.1 Process for establishing eIDSR in Malawi  i.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Stakeholders engagement and establishment of eIDSR taskforce  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The success of eIDSR requires an effective engagement of all relevant stakeholders.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 In the context of Malawi, PHIM (the department responsible for IDSR) engaged the Digital Health Unit and key development partners to develop the eIDSR since 2015. An eIDSR taskforce was formed and is responsible for coordinating eIDSR development and implementation works. When PHIM initiated the eIDSR system development, the surveillance group engaged with the department that handles health information system. These two departments brought together all relevant stakeholders in the country to develop a technical working group required for coordinating eIDSR implementation. eIDSR implementation in Malawi is leveraging the ICT capacity provided by other line ministries, especially ministries of ICT.  ii. Assess country IDSR functionality  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The government had committed to utilize digital solutions for public service. The JEE and recent joint study with MOH partner emphasized the transformation of IDSR from paper to electronic system. In Malawi the IDSR functionality was assessed at all levels in 2015, this also included the assessment of political commitment to use ICT as a pivot of development and social transformation. The PHIM (IDSR unit) is designated to follow up on disease surveillance activities and implementation including the eIDSR development. The appointment of a disease surveillance focal point at district level across the nation was the key point in the success of eIDSR implementation.  iii. Determine country capabilities and needs  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 A crucial step in the development of an electronic system is to assess the capabilities and infrastructure needs of the country. The eIDSR technical working group or a similar TWG which oversees surveillance activities should carefully consider the capabilities and infrastructure and resources against the needs of their surveillance system. WHO has developed a standardized eSurveillance assessment tool which can also be used as a resource tool  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Network coverage  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Assessing the network capability in country to determine the type of system that can be developed. Internet and mobile network coverage for the major networks i.e. TNM and AIRTEL is a key component to consider. Other key areas to consider includes, number of internet providers, cost of subscription, internet speed, internet coverage, number of mobile connection providers, cost of text messages, cost of phone calls, type of operating system, explore alternative sophisticated models to extend connectivity through TV white space, balloon, drone or low orbiting satellite based internet connectivity to extend coverage to remote or hard to reach areas.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Power supply option  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Availability of power supply is a key input for a successful eIDSR. A reliable power supply to suit the needs of the system must be available at the level of implementation. For example, connection to the power grid, consistent generator with fuel provision, power banks or solar power.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Equipment – data capture, data management, data analysis  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Equipment is an essential component of eIDSR. It is important to assess the equipment available for eIDSR in country at each level of the health system. Malawi has adopted a model that advocates for mHealth solutions at community level with offline data capture capabilities while at health facility level we are instituting both desktop/laptop computers and gadgets for mHealth. Malawi through the Digital Health Unit is developing a model that considers the lifecycle of each hardware, and developing a plan for replacing/renewing as needed.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Hardware\\xa0  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The Malawi HIS policy dictates that all health related data must be hosted within the borders of Malawi, currently the Ministry of Health is working on instituting a more sustainable data centre infrastructure to host all health digital solutions in Malawi. All government health systems are hosted at a national server room at CHSU in the department of HIV&AIDS. MOH have dedicated team of system administrators managing the data centre to its optimal level.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Consider types of mobile devices required including smart phones. eIDSR (OHSP) is equipped with the latest tablet android gadgets as of October 2020.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0Consider the availability of power and how to ensure uninterruptable power \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  \\xa0\\xa0 supply.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Software for surveillance or similar function  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 All eIDSR implementations including the community mobile applications should all leveraged and converge into the OHSP/DHIS2 as the main surveillance digital data repository.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Partnerships through the TWGs between system developers and other stakeholders are key in developing software which could be flexible and easily adaptable.  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Devices  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 All IDSR focal personnel are equipped with Tablet android devices and PHIM  is working on replacing the ordinary data capturing tools(phones).  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Human resources – technical capacity  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The MoH has a pool of systems developers within the Digital Health Unit, that are currently spearheading the development of the eIDSR solution by adhering to the COVID-19 IDSR guidelines.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Computer literacy of the staff is key for those who will use the electronic system that is developed, PHIM is conducting an in-person training to all IDSR focal persons from all health facilities across the country. PHIM is developing a strategy on training and retraining the surveillance teams as technology evolves.  iv. Availability of partnerships  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Partnership frameworks for public private partnerships with telecom operators to support eIDSR systems should be explored jointly with ministries responsible of ICTs and telecoms.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Explore if there are the necessary partnerships available for implementing eIDSR  v. \\xa0Determine appropriate scope of eIDSR implementation, including One Health \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 approach  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Based on the assessments above, countries should determine the scope of implementing the eIDSR (alert notification, case-based reporting, routine weekly reporting, routine monthly reporting, outbreak/emergency management). Countries can start with any approach that fits their needs and capacity at the time, and later add on other functions. Obtain estimates for initial investments and ongoing costs  Countries should determine potential investors. \\u2028 vi. Roll out the eIDSR plan  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Develop and launch country-specific eIDSR implementation plan.  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Develop annual operational plan (timelines, costs, responsibilities) and long-term (5 years) national eSurveillance plan in the framework of existing integrated health plan(s)  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Consider a step wise incremental process in implementing the plan and training  ₋\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Incorporate routine monitoring and regular evaluations, including an initial baseline assessment prior to implementation  9.7.2 Important considerations for a successful eIDSR  The following are considered as important considerations for successful implementation of eIDSR in a country  a.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Laboratory integration  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 i.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 System should link with lab data or have the ability to link to lab data in the future.

i.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Ideally, data can be shared across systems, including with the surveillance system from the animal and other relevant sectors.  9.8 Use of eIDSR in core surveillance functions  There are many components that will ensure the successful implementation of eIDSR in the public health sector. These components include understanding the scope and operational environment, using the right tools and building the capabilities within the local context. The One Health approach also provides an opportunity for creating interoperable, interconnected electronic reporting systems between human and animal surveillance system.\\xa0  The use of e-tools for the conduct of Data Quality Assessment/Assurance (DQA) is also part of a monitoring and evaluation strategy of IDSR functions which can be used for continuing improvement of the quality of data. Such tools can identify errors, inconsistencies and other data anomalies which can lead into data that are reliable, accurate, precise and complete.  Within the context of the country, the establishment of electronic platform can facilitate the implementation of the following IDSR activities as described in previous sections of the document:  a)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Real-time reporting (indicator and event based surveillance) – Refer to Introduction Section  b)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Alert notification (community and health facility reporting) – Refer to section 2 of Booklet 2  c)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Case-based reporting – Refer to section 2 of Booklet 2  d)\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Routine reporting (weekly aggregates) and Routine monthly reporting - Refer to section 2 of Booklet 2.

These roles should also be complemented by spec\\xadific roles as described in relevant sections.  · Community level  o\\xa0\\xa0 Contribute information on events e.g. through toll-free helplines  o\\xa0\\xa0 Act on alert message sent from health authorities  · Health facility level  o\\xa0\\xa0 Depending on the eIDSR platform, report events requiring immediate action  o\\xa0\\xa0 Submit weekly IDSR reports  o\\xa0\\xa0 Follow-up on events that are reported by community  o\\xa0\\xa0 Act on notifications and respond as recommended for their area of jurisdiction  o\\xa0\\xa0 Ensure compatibility of their handset with the eIDSR  o\\xa0\\xa0 Ensure maintenance and ownership of handset and other tools  · District level  o\\xa0\\xa0 Provide staff access to the eIDSR  o\\xa0\\xa0 Verify and Approve onward transmission of reported events from lower health facilities  o\\xa0\\xa0 Issue alerts to other facilities and leaders regarding events within the district  o\\xa0\\xa0 Provide feedback to the reporting health facility regarding the event  o\\xa0\\xa0 Update the health facilities and leaders regarding progress in the response  o\\xa0\\xa0 Training, mentorship and supervision of health staff  o\\xa0\\xa0 Mobilization of resources to support effective implementation of eIDSR  o\\xa0\\xa0 Ensure availability compatibility of ICT equipment with the eIDSR  · Central/ National level  o\\xa0\\xa0 Maintaining the server  o\\xa0\\xa0 Developing and updating electronic tools  o\\xa0\\xa0 Managing the eIDSR system, including troubleshooting  o\\xa0\\xa0 Maintaining system administration (registration of health staff using server)  o\\xa0\\xa0 Training and supervision  o\\xa0\\xa0 Provide feedback  o\\xa0\\xa0 Issue alerts to other facilities  o\\xa0\\xa0 Coordination of partners and stakeholders  o\\xa0\\xa0 Ensuring linkage with other platforms, to facilitate interoperability  o\\xa0\\xa0 Monitoring alerts  o\\xa0\\xa0 Advocacy to policy makers and mobilizing resources to sustain the system  o\\xa0\\xa0 Ensuring data security  o\\xa0\\xa0 Oversee development and implementation of a national eHealth/digital health strategy  o\\xa0\\xa0 Align eIDSR investments and work with the national eHealth/digital health strategy  o\\xa0\\xa0 Country eHealth/digital health architecture with consideration for re-usable components  o\\xa0\\xa0 System governance  · WHO and other regional bodies (AU, ECSA, SADC etc.)  o\\xa0\\xa0 Facilitate creation of formal platform for sharing information and data across countries  o\\xa0\\xa0 Technical assistance to member states  o\\xa0\\xa0 Share best practices and facilitate exchange of expertise  9.10 Supervision, Monitoring and Evaluation  ·\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 eIDSR development and implementation requires constant monitoring. This is very important during the initial system development and implementation phase. System functionality can be evaluated by looking on issues like;  Acceptability or willing to participate. ie number of people who are accessing and using the system correctly  Accessibility; is the system accessible from the place where the reporting site is situated. In some areas where mobile telephone is used for eIDSR, accessibility is important aspect and this can hamper the reporting of diseases on time.  c.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Data quality and completeness.

The IDSR support supervision checklist shall be used during supervisory visit, while considering the integrated needs from other teams in terms of joint supervision. Supportive supervision checklist has to be updated to incorporate eIDSR and uploaded as part of the eIDSR platform. The overall evaluation of the eIDSR system and its interoperability with the HMIS and eHealth system should be done periodically, using a blend of internal and external experts.  9.11 References  1.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Meeting report of the 3rd Meeting on African Surveillance Informatics Governance Board (ASIGB), WHO internal report. 16-18 July 2015, Cape Town, South Africa  2.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 eSurveillance in the context of Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response in the WHO African Region: An essential platform for priority diseases, conditions and events surveillance and response.

Stakeholders and Partners for risk communication\\t182 7.6 References\\t183 FOREWORD In 1998, the World Health Organization (WHO) Regional Office for Africa (AFRO) together with technical partners adopted a strategy for developing and implementing comprehensive public health surveillance and response systems in African countries, initially called integrated disease surveillance (IDS). However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats.  The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi adopted in 2014. Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using new guidelines for the IDSR revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018. This Third Edition has now been reviewed to include the new developments. The manual contains practical guidelines for use as a general reference for surveillance activities at all levels; and as a resource material for developing training, supervision and evaluation of surveillance activities. It is worth noting that, many public health events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate.  To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to implement these IDSR technical guidelines.  These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.  Dr. Charles Mwansambo Secretary for Health ACKNOWLEDGMENTS The third edition of the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) Technical Guidelines was prepared by the WHO with technical reviews provided by the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). Malawi adapted the revised IDSR technical guidelines with the purpose of  aligning with the current situation and needs of the country; aligning with the objectives, targets and elements of the WHO Africa region’s strategy for health security and emergencies 2016 to 2020;  updating the technical guidelines with contemporary information, taking into consideration new developments such as: emerging and re-emerging priority diseases, conditions and events; incorporating recent recommendations from expert panels on strengthening the IHR, 2005 that are underpinned on the One Health approach; holistically addressing disaster risk management (DRM) strategies;  taking into account lessons learnt from the unprecedented EVD outbreak in West Africa, polio eradication and other humanitarian crises; taking advantage of technology advancement and utilize the  opportunities offered by the internet and mobile phones to scale up the implementation of real time community event based surveillance (CEBS), with robust geographical information system (GIS) platforms; scaling up other electronic surveillance systems and incorporate new ways for capacity building using the IDSR eLearning tools.

An outbreak is defined as an increase in the number of cases of a disease or an event above what is normally expected in that population in a given area over a particular period of time. When an outbreak or any public health event or condition is detected and notified, there are several steps which are required for an outbreak investigation (see figure 4.1). These steps are usually listed in order, but their order of implementation is often non-sequential. Knowing these steps prepares one to conduct an investigation properly, using common sense and logic to determine when, how often, and to what extent the different steps should be implemented in a real investigation. These steps can also be used to investigate other public health problems in the district such as when an increase in chronic or non-communicable disease is detected.  The results of an investigation of an outbreak or other public health event leads to identification and assessment of people who have been exposed to an infectious disease or affected by an unusual health event. The investigation provides relevant information to use for taking immediate action and improving longer-term disease prevention activities. The purpose of an investigation is to: Verify the outbreak or the public health event and risk. Identify and treat additional cases that have not been reported or recognized. Collect information and laboratory specimens for confirming the diagnosis. Identify the source of infection or cause of the outbreak. Describe the epidemiological situation in time, place and person Describe how the disease is transmitted and the populations at risk Select appropriate response activities to control the outbreak or the public health event Strengthen prevention activities to avoid future reoccurrence of the outbreak.  Decide to investigate a reported outbreak, or public health event  The districts have the overall responsibility for investigating outbreaks and public health events. The national level provides technical support and policy guidance. This guideline also applies to health facility level. For some communicable diseases, a single suspected case is the trigger for taking action, reporting the case to a higher level, and conducting an investigation. This is because these are dangerous diseases with either the potential for rapid transmission or high case fatality rates if cases are not treated promptly. For other diseases, the trigger is when cases reach a defined threshold (e.g. a particular number of cases per 100,000 population) in a defined community, geographical area or season. Sometimes an appearance of a single case of a communicable disease which has been absent from a population for a long period, or caused by an agent (e.g. bacterium or virus) not previously recognized in that community or area, or the emergence of a previously unknown disease or event, may also constitute an outbreak and should be reported and investigated. Health staff should promptly investigate the problem and respond to the immediate cases. Preparations for taking a wider public health response should also be made. Alert and epidemic thresholds are also described in Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines in detail.  NOTE: The threshold for some diseases will not change between districts or health facilities because the thresholds trigger immediate notification, and are set by national policy Still, some urgent health events require investigations to be started immediately. Regardless, districts should aim to investigate suspected outbreaks and events within 48 hours of notification from lower level. Conduct an investigation when: The district receives a report of a suspected outbreak due to a disease that is targeted for immediate notification An unusual increase is seen in the number of cases or deaths during routine analysis of data Alert or epidemic thresholds have been reached for specific priority diseases. The initial trigger for a new epidemic prone disease could be the laboratory Communities or social media report rumours of deaths or a large number of cases that are not being seen in the health facility A cluster of illnesses or deaths occurs for which the cause is not explained or is unusual (for example, an adult death due to bloody diarrhoea, cluster of illness among health care workers, cluster of animal (domestic and/or wildlife) deaths e.g. birds die offs due to avian influenza, livestock deaths due to anthrax, unusual abortion events in livestock) (ii)  Verify the reported information Investigating outbreaks requires human, logistic and financial resources. When a suspected outbreak or event is reported, promptly verify that the information is accurate and reflects conditions suggesting a true outbreak or event. This will help to ensure that resources are used effectively. To verify the information, consider the following factors: Source of information (for example, is the source of the rumour reliable? Is the report from a health facility or a community or social media?) Severity of the reported illness and use of standard case definition for reporting Number of reported cases and deaths The age and sex of reported cases or deaths Mode of transmission of suspected pathogen and risk for wider transmission Political or geographic considerations Importance of maintaining good partner and community relations Available resources. Is it of national or international concern? After taking the above factors into consideration, the situation may require a more urgent response than might otherwise have occurred. For example, reports of a suspected viral haemorrhagic fever case are treated with more urgency than reports of a less virulent disease because of the potential for high rates of death and rapid transmission. Regardless of the factors, all suspected outbreaks or events (including immediately notifiable diseases or events) reported from health facilities need to be reported to the next level within 24 hours. (iii) Record reported outbreaks, public health events and alerts Prepare a method for tracking the reporting of suspected outbreaks, events and rumours to the district/national level. The purpose for tracking reported outbreaks is to ensure that the report of each suspected outbreak, public health event or alert is followed by some action and resolution. Keeping this record will help to gather information for evaluating the timeliness and completeness of the outbreak investigation and response process. A sample form for tracking reports of outbreaks and rumours is in Annex 4A of this section. If the district is using a district analysis workbook for recording and analysing long-term trends, the district should include the tracking form in the District Log book of alerts and rumours Where feasible, outbreak alerts should be recorded and managed using electronic event management systems (refer to Section 9 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines).  4.1 Prepare to conduct an investigation 4.1.1 Mobilize Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Team (PHERRT)   Before embarking on an outbreak investigation, consider necessary preparations. These include preparing the team with appropriate information, and data about the suspected disease so that everyone knows what to look for, and what precautions are needed. If the disease is known, the team needs to pay particular attention to symptoms, case definitions, modes of transmission, diagnostic tests, control measures, etc. Mobilize the District Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Team (PHERRT) and make arrangements for investigating the report. The District Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Team (PHERRT) is a technical, multi-disciplinary team that is available for quick mobilization and deployment to support the field response to a suspected or confirmed outbreak or event. Include the district coordinator for the disease or event being investigated and any other relevant staff who have already been identified and trained to be part of the rapid response team in the investigation planning. (Note: periodically review and update the immunization status of personnel who take part in infectious diseases outbreak investigation and response activities.). It is advisable to have a database of trained public health workers who can rapidly be mobilized to fulfil the following functions;  Coordination,  Surveillance/Epidemiology Laboratory confirmation  Case management Infection Prevention Control (IPC) Environmental health and sanitation  Risk communication and Community Engagement   Animal health (as applicable) Logistics  Security (as applicable) In resource-constrained settings, experts that can fulfil more than one function may be co-opted into the PHERRT.  The composition of the PHERRT should have at least the following;  IDSR Coordinator – Team Leader A clinician/nurse  IPC Coordinator Community health nurse Surveillance officer Epidemiologist  Data manager Laboratory personnel Environmental Health Officer Veterinary/Livestock/Wildlife Officer Health Promotion Officer Mental Health Coordinator Health Services Administrator Pharmacist Others based on specific characteristics of the outbreak (e.g. expert in water sector–if cholera outbreak or if suspected poisoning from mines- expert on chemicals or radio-nuclear, Pharmacy and Medicines Regulatory Authority) Section 5 will describe in detail the composition of other teams in responding to an outbreak and other public health events. With the team, develop terms of reference that define the objectives of the investigation so that the essential information will be gathered for investigating the outbreak and implementing the most appropriate and relevant response. Discuss also, who are the stakeholders or parties involved. The national level may deploy a team to support the districts to investigate and respond to the outbreak/public health emergency as per the national policy. This includes standard guidelines and Standard Operating Procedures (SOP)/methods that are relevant to the disease or condition being investigated (for example, SOP for collecting the correct laboratory specimen, case management guidelines, case investigation forms, line-listing forms) – refer to the existing documents/ guidelines for the specific condition/event. 4.1.2 Specify tasks of the people and what they are expected to do Inform health workers about their responsibilities during the investigation and the functions they will support. Specify tentative timelines for the work. Contribute to the positive motivation for doing the investigation. For example, make sure that the investigation team understands the link between the investigation results and the selection of response activities for preventing additional cases and saving lives. Ensure that all health and non-health staffs in the team have access to and know how to use required Personal Protection Equipment (PPE) and universal precautions relevant for the possible cause of the suspected outbreak or event. 4.1.3 Define supervision and communication lines Make a plan for how the team will communicate during an investigation. Prepare a diagram showing who will report to whom and how information will move both within the investigation team and between the district and other levels, including the most local level. For example, define who will communicate with the Ministry of Health, the media and the community. State the methods for communicating and how often it should be done during an outbreak to keep officials informed. Methods may include daily updates by radiophone, mobile phone, facsimile, electronic mail or conference calls. Show on the diagram the lines of authority and the roles of each staff on the team. Define the role of non-health workers and how they should be supervised. It is essential to have in place a communication procedure for communication with the community and key partners. This is important for ensuring the sharing of critical information about identifying and responding to risks associated with the outbreak or event. 4.1.4 Decide where the investigation will take place Review information already known about the suspected outbreak or public health event, including mode of transmission and risk factors. Use this information to define the geographical boundaries and target population for conducting the investigation. Begin the investigation in the most affected place. Contact nearby health facilities/veterinary office to determine if they have seen similar cases or an increase in cases with the same diagnosis. Involve the community and local health facility staff in planning and conducting the investigation. Listen to and seek out information about local customs, culture, and routines that could affect the success of the outbreak investigation. 4.1.5 Obtain the required authorizations Observe the appropriate authorizations, clearances, ethical norms and permissions that are required to do the investigation. In addition to official authorizations, make sure to include agreements with community member of influence in the community. 4.1.6 Finalize forms and methods for collecting information and specimens Select those variables needed to identify, record and analyse the disease being investigated (A selection of case investigation forms with key variables noted are in the Annex 4E). Depending on staff responsibilities, review how to: Record case information on a line list for later use in summarizing variables for use in time, place and person analysis Fill appropriate request forms, label laboratory samples properly and use a unique ID number for a given case Prepare (and update as needed) an epidemic curve Construct a spot map showing location of geographic variables such as location of cases and deaths Develop analysis tables for risk factors, age group, sex, immunization status and so on. 4.1.7 Arrange transportation and other logistics Make travel arrangements for getting to and from the site of the investigation and for travelling during the investigation. Make sure transportation for moving specimens to the appropriate laboratories has been arranged in advance of the team’s departure. Other logistics such as medical supplies, vaccines, PPEs should also be available  4.1.8 Gather supplies for collecting laboratory specimens Some districts may already have in place a rapid response kit that contains supplies and equipment for carrying out an investigation (including laboratory supplies). If a kit is not available in your district, look at the disease specific program guidelines and talk to laboratory personnel to find out the requirements for laboratory supplies for proper collection, storage, and transport of relevant specimens (refer to Annex 4B). Use of personal protective equipment (PPE) and disinfection materials is strongly recommended (refer to Annex 4C). Refer to the disease specific guidelines in Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines for laboratory requirements. 4.2 Verify and confirm the outbreak or event 4.2.1 Review the clinical history and epidemiology Examine the patient or patients’ records to confirm that their signs and symptoms meet the case definition. Ask the patient or a family member who can speak for the patient: Where do you live? When did the symptoms begin? Who else is sick in your home, school, workplace, village, neighbourhood? Where have you travelled to recently? Where have you been living recently prior to the onset of symptoms (residence at time of infection)? Were you visited by anyone recently? Who took care of you when you started feeling sick? Have you been in contact with sick or dead animals (both domestic and wildlife) recently (for zoonosis)? Have you been in contact with any sick or dead person? Has anybody died in the community you live recently? Did you participate in the burial ceremony (What role did you play?) For suspected AEFIs, what vaccines have you received recently? If food borne outbreak, what food did you take recently (specify period); How many others consumed? If water borne, what was the source of water? Note:  Always use the minimum PPEs 4.2.2 Collect laboratory specimens and obtain laboratory results to confirm the diagnosis If the disease can be confirmed by laboratory testing, refer to the laboratory requirements in Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines to determine the diagnostic test and the specimen that is required. The disease specific laboratory requirements also describe how to collect, store and transport the relevant specimen, and how many specimens to collect to confirm an outbreak for that particular disease. Some samples using a triple package technique (See Annex 4H). Note that some diseases may require additional food or environmental samples to aid in diagnosis and ensure that these samples are also collected e.g. water and food samples for water borne and food borne outbreaks respectively. Review laboratory results with the investigation team at the health facility. Are the laboratory results consistent with the clinical findings? Seek additional assistance from national level program managers or technical experts if you have any questions about the laboratory results. 4.3 Define and search for additional cases 4.3.1 Define a Case After establishing that there is an outbreak, and verifying the correct diagnosis, a crucial step is to define what constitutes a case in this investigation. In section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, a list of standard case definitions for most IDSR priority diseases is already available. Even in situations where a case definition might be available, in specific outbreaks, other details are necessary to be included in the case definitions and these include geographical location, attendance at an event or travel to a certain location. In some circumstances, you might encounter a new disease not listed in the Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines and you will need to develop an operational case definition. The common elements of a case definition include information on symptoms, date of onset of symptoms, laboratory results, and the essential elements of person, place, and time. 4.3.2 Isolate and treat cases as necessary Use the case definition to isolate cases. Isolation is a critical step in limiting spread of disease and keeping healthcare facilities open and healthcare workers available. Depending on the suspected disease, immediate isolation may be required to protect staff, patients, and community members. Ensure the cases in isolation units have access to facilities like water and sanitary facilities. The health facility should be provided with advice, support and supplies. Use standard case management and infection prevention and control guidelines to manage cases.  Use standard precaution with all patients in the health facility and in the community, especially during an infectious disease outbreak. 4.3.2 Search for additional cases Once the initial cases have been clinically confirmed and treatment has begun, actively search for additional cases. (i) Search for suspected cases and deaths in the health facility records In the health facilities where cases have been reported, search for additional suspected cases and deaths in the registers. Look for other patients who may have presented with the same or similar signs and symptoms as the disease or condition being investigated. The team should request health workers to search for similar cases in the neighbouring health facilities and in health facilities where the person may have passed there during travelling. See Annex 4D at the end of this section for instructions on conducting a register review. Make sure to follow up any cases that have been allowed to go home. (ii) Search for contact persons and suspected deaths in the community Identify all areas of likely risk where the patients have lived, worked, or travelled like parties, family outside the country, visiting zoo, poultry farm, laboratory, or hunting sites. Also talk to other informants in the community such as chemical sellers, school teachers, veterinarians (to know about the animal health situation), farmers, and community leaders. The areas for the search may be influenced by the disease, its mode of transmission, and factors of risk related to time, place and person. Visit those places and talk to people who had, or were likely to have had, contact with the patient. Ask if they or anyone they know has had an illness or condition like the one being investigated. Find out if anyone else in the area around the case has been ill with signs or symptoms that meet the case definition. Find out if there were any recent deaths. If they say yes, find out what were the signs and symptoms of the person(s) that died. Enquire about the people that took care of these people when they were sick and also the preparation of the dead before and during the burial ceremony. Collect information that will help to describe the magnitude and geographic extent of the outbreak. Refer newly identified cases to the health facility for treatment. See Annexes 4E and 4F of this section for examples of forms for recording and following-up on contacts for additional cases. 4.4 Develop a line list and record information about the additional cases For each new case, either in the health facility register or in searches from the community, that fits the surveillance case definition, record the collected information on a line list register, as well as in the case-based reporting form or other recommended form. Where possible, include geo-mapping coordinates. A line list register will keep track of pertinent basic data for cases and potential cases as they are identified (See Annex 4E for a sample line list register). For infectious diseases, list any contacts on the contact listing form and ensure they are monitored daily for the required time for signs and symptoms of the disease (See Annex 4F and 4G) Record information of all cases on a “case based surveillance reporting form” (See sample Annex 2F). At least record the following: The patient’s name, physical address, (village or neighbourhood, GVH, TA, district) for locating information. If a specific address is not available, record information that can be used to contact patients if additional information is needed or to notify the patient about laboratory and investigation results The patient’s age and sex. This information is used to describe the characteristics of the population affected by the disease The date of onset of symptoms and date the patient was first seen at the health facility The status of the patient whether dead or alive. If dead, record date of death.  Relevant risk factor information such as immunization status if the disease being investigated is a vaccine-preventable disease; occupation if you suspect occupation is related to that particular outbreak. The name and designation of the person reporting the information. Complete the case based surveillance form for any new cases (see Annex 2F) and record the details on the line list (Annex 4E)  Some diseases have their own more detailed case investigation form. Detailed forms outlining particular information for investigating specific diseases are in the Annexes at the end of Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines. 4.5 Analyse data about the outbreak  The methods for analysing outbreak data are similar to how the analysis of summary data is described in Section 3. Data about the outbreak is analysed and re-analysed many times during the course of an outbreak. During the initial analysis, summarize the outbreak or events and look for clues about where the outbreak or event is occurring, how it is spreading, the source of the outbreak (from a single source, for example (a well or a funeral), and the persons at risk of becoming ill (for example, young children, refugees, person living in rural areas, and so on).  Present the data, taking into account time, place and person analysis (refer to Section 3) in the following way: Draw a histogram representing the course of the disease (an “Epi” curve). Plot the cases on a spot map. Make tables of the most relevant characteristics for cases (for example, comparing age group with vaccination status, sex ratio, comparing type of occupation in relation to cases etc.). Calculate case fatality rates (refer to the steps in Section 3) In outbreak situation, apart from Case fatality rates, you may also wish to calculate attack rates. See section 3, on how to calculate the Attack rate. 4.5.1 Interpret analysis results Review the analysis results while identifying potential risk factors for an outbreak. For example: What was the causal agent of the outbreak? What was the source of infection? What was the transmission pattern? What control measures were implemented and to what effect? (i) Interpret the time analysis results Look at the histogram and observe the shape of the epidemic curve. Draw conclusions about when exposure to the agent that caused the illness occurred, the source of infection and related incubation period. If the shape of the curve suddenly increases to develop a steep up-slope, and then descends just as rapidly, exposure to the causal agent was probably over a brief period of time. There may be a common source of infection. If the shape of the epidemic curve is a plateau rather than a sharp peak, exposure to the common source is more likely to be over a long period of time. If the curve presents as a series of progressively taller peaks separated by periods of incubation, the illness resulted from person-to-person transmission. Below are some of the examples of the shapes of epidemic curves and possible interpretation: Figure 4.2: Types of Epidemic Curves and the manner of spread ￼ (ii) Interpret the place analysis results Use the map to: Describe the geographic extent of the problem and identify high risk areas. Identify and describe any clusters or patterns of transmission or exposure. Depending on the organism that has contributed to this outbreak, specify the proximity of the cases to likely sources of infection. (iii) Interpret the person analysis results Information developed from the person analysis is essential for planning the outbreak response because it describes more precisely the high-risk group(s) for transmission of this disease or condition. For example, if yellow fever cases occurred in patients less than 15 years of age, then the immunization response might need to target children less than 15 years of age. Below is an example of data analysis by person (age) which shows how the results could be used to plan for interventions. Table 4.1 below shows highest rates of disease among persons aged 15 years and above: Table 4.1: Cholera attack rate by age group, Mankhokwe Camp, Malawi, March-May 1988 Age group (years)\\ufdd0Number of cases\\ufdd0Population\\ufdd0Attack rate (%)\\ufdd0< 5\\ufdd0131\\ufdd05,303\\ufdd02.5%\\ufdd05-14\\ufdd0261\\ufdd012,351\\ufdd02.1%\\ufdd0> 15\\ufdd0392\\ufdd012,091\\ufdd03.2%\\ufdd0Total\\ufdd0784\\ufdd029,745\\ufdd02.6% Source: Reproduced with persmission of the publisher, from Moren et al, 1991 (iv) Analyse data and generate hypothesis Conduct descriptive analyse of data (Person, Place and Time) From the observations gathered during the descriptive process, a hypothesis can be generated about the causes of observed patterns and the factors that increase risk for given outbreak. E.g. in Table 4.1 above, one might hypothesize that the older you are, the more likely you fell ill and one might want to determine if age is associated with illness. Using descriptive analysis generate hypothesis of outbreak  To test a hypothesis, one must use an analytic epidemiology process to answer questions of how and why the population was affected (v) Test and refine hypothesis with analytic study  Based on descriptive epidemiology and situation, select appropriate study design Obtain resources to conduct and analyse study Draw conclusion from study and as needed refine hypothesis  In conducting analytic studies, there are various study designs which can be used. These include case control studies, or cohort studies or experimental studies. An examples of an analytical study (case-control) to test hypothesis can be found in Annex 4I. Refer to the references for further guidance on how to conduct analytical study designs. 4.6 Report writing and dissemination of findings All reports (Preliminary, Interim and final) should always be disseminated, even if no conclusive risk factors have been identified for a given outbreak. Prepare also situation reports (SitReps) of the given outbreak and share with relevant stakeholders. Section 7, describes various channels of communication during outbreak. If risk factors are already known, formulate conclusions and recommendations about the outbreak: Situation is confirmed as an outbreak or public health problem. Population affected and at risk, place and time. Possible causes of the outbreak/public health problem, laboratory results, source of infection, mode of transmission, attack rate, case fatality rate and possible risk factors. Measures already initiated to contain the outbreak. Recommendations: For controlling the situation further investigation/studies may be recommended. The district rapid response team should then immediately prepare an outbreak investigation report. This detailed report of the outbreak investigation should be prepared and disseminated immediately to the health facility where the outbreak occurred, district, national and also WHO.  A suggested outline for writing an investigation report is described in Annex 7D of Section 7. To understand the spread of the disease you should draw a transmission tree starting with the index case. Moreover, the transmission tree assists in understanding the relative contributions of different settings to the spread of the disease in the given geographical area and hence regulates the infection transmission and the control measures. Reconstruction of a transmission chain or tree can be done provided the information is obtained from line list, and also a review of the timeline of dates of illness or contact with other cases, field investigations, and rapid risk assessment. The transmission tree is important as it assists in documenting the routes of transmission in a given geographical area and hence enables planned interventions.  The tree needs to be updated frequently and if a new cluster of cases starts in any part of the district try to ask questions to establish an epidemiological link (See Annex 4J for an example of how to draw a transmission tree). 4.7 Implement prevention and control measures Once an outbreak is identified, control measures are important for interrupting disease transmission and or limiting exposure to the source of infection and preventing occurrence of future outbreaks. If a pathogen or other suspected source of the outbreak is identified, control measures should target specific agents, sources, or reservoirs of infection. Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines gives a description of some of the control measures for each priority diseases and references for further reading. Note:  Control measures should be implemented at the first available point in the investigation and should occur concurrently with other investigation steps. Often, non-specific control measures can be put into place regardless of the type of disease or source.  Ensure multi-sectoral engagement throughout response i.e. from community level to other non-health stakeholders who might be key for the particular outbreaks. Examples if you want to enforce by law, you might need assistance from the ministry responsible for security.  At some point, during the outbreak setting, public health response might include also testing new potential countermeasures including vaccines and therapeutics. Thus, the conduct of biomedical research can be an important and discrete component of the response. Public health efforts must always remain at the forefront of the overall outbreak response. The research must be conducted in a scientifically and ethically sound manner to reach definitive conclusions about efficacy and safety as expeditiously as possible. It is the role of the National Level to liaise with the Ethical Committees Body within the country to provide a useful guide for analogous principles in outbreak situations in such settings  4.8 Conduct an assessment to determine if the event is a potential Public Health Emergency    of International Concern (PHEIC)  Risk assessment should be initiated as soon as possible by the designated investigation team to address the following questions: Is the public health impact of the event serious? Is the event unusual or unexpected? Is there a significant risk of international spread? Is there a significant risk of international travel or trade restrictions? The national level may be called upon to participate in the risk assessment at the end of which the decision will be made on whether the event is potential PHEIC hence warranting its notification (IHR decision instrument, http://www.who.int/ihr/revised_annex2A_guidance.pdf) 4.9 Maintain and intensify surveillance  The national level should maintain contact with the district for daily updates (cases, deaths, number admitted, number discharged, areas affected, etc.) until end of the epidemic. Ensure that the same IDSR mechanism is used to enhance surveillance of events, and that the system is flexible enough to allow adaptation of additional variables to be collected using the existing system. This will avoid parallel reporting which can lead to confusion on the progress of the outbreak Periodically, report on progress of response, and prepare daily situation reports which can be used to evaluate the response  Update the line list, conduct data analysis by time, person and place  Monitor effectiveness of the outbreak or response activity During investigation, it is important also to intensify surveillance with neighbouring districts to ensure the outbreak does not spill to another district. It is important to share information and also plan for joint surveillance and response activities. Neighbouring districts may also initiate the establishment of the cross-border disease surveillance and response committees so that there is sharing of surveillance data, epidemiological and other related information during the outbreak.  4.10 Conducting regular risk assessment after the outbreak has been confirmed As soon as the outbreak is confirmed, it is important to conduct regular assessment at each stage of the outbreak. The assessment is needed so as to aid in focusing interventions. The risk assessment should include; Evaluating the susceptibility of the population and potential for spread of the event both in the affected as well as neighbouring areas Evaluating the risk of further transmission, morbidity and mortality. For this, factors that can be taken on board include population characteristics such as size, density, movement, and setting; under five mortality rates; period of the year (considering potential for seasonal outbreak) and plans for any festivals or other social events that will result in increased opportunities for spread; access to health services etc. A risk assessment should be repeated as new information becomes available. It may also be repeated on a regular timetable. For some events, different risk assessment teams may be required to work collaboratively to assemble the information for a composite picture of the risk (e.g. clinical severity, transmission dynamics, and control measures). At the conclusion of the event, all the risk assessments should be formally reviewed. The systematic analysis of well-documented risk assessments identifies where improvements can be made in the management of acute public health events in future. 4.11 Annexes to Section 4 Annex 4A: \\tDistrict log of suspected outbreaks and rumours Annex 4B: \\tChecklist of laboratory supplies for use in an outbreak investigation  Annex 4C: \\tRecommended list of personal protective equipment Annex 4D: \\tHow to conduct a register review Annex 4E: \\tSample line list  Annex 4F: \\tContact recording sheet  Annex 4G: \\tContact tracing form (follow-up)  Annex 4H: \\tTriple Packaging of samples during an Outbreak  Annex 4I:\\tExample of an Analytical study to test hypothesis  Annex 4J: \\tHow to create a transmission tree Annex 4A: District log of suspected outbreaks and alerts Record verbal or written information from health facilities or communities or social media about suspected outbreaks, alerts, or reports of unexplained events.

Explain that the information will be used to determine what caused the outbreak or increase in number of cases. The register should be used for; Any inpatient facility with more than 10 hospital beds.  Large reference or teaching hospitals with paediatric wards because they receive referrals from other health facilities. Small hospitals or health facilities that serve remote areas and high-risk populations. For example, nomadic groups, refugees, or areas without regularly scheduled health services. Meet with the health facility staff and explain the purpose of the review Explain to the health facility’s senior staff the purpose of the review. The information will assist the district and health facility in determining the most appropriate action for limiting the outbreak and preventing future cases from occurring. Emphasize that the activity is an information-gathering exercise, and is not a review of health worker performance. Arrange to conduct the review Arrange a time to conduct the review when staffs who will assist with the review are present and available to help or to answer questions. Identify sources of information During the visit, depending on the priority disease or condition or events being investigated, check inpatient registers for the paediatric and infectious disease wards. The inpatient register for the paediatric ward is a good source because it lists all children admitted to the ward. Annual summary reports are not always accurate, and outpatient registers often include only a provisional diagnosis. Review the system and procedures health workers use to record information in the registers about diagnoses. Make sure that the information needed for investigating any suspected case is available. At a minimum, the register should include: --\\tThe patient’s name and location --\\tThe signs and symptoms --\\tDate of onset of symptoms and outcome (for example, date of death, if relevant) --\\tImmunization status, if appropriate to this disease. If the health facility does not keep at least the minimum information, talk with senior staff about how to strengthen the record keeping so that the minimum information is collected. Conduct the record review at the scheduled date and time Go to the selected wards as scheduled. During the visit, look in the health facility registers for cases and deaths that may be suspected cases of a priority disease. These should be cases or deaths that meet the standard case definition for suspected cases. Find out whether the suspected case was investigated and reported according to the national guidelines. Line-list the suspected cases that are found. Record information about the suspected cases. This information will be used during case investigation activities. Provide feedback to the health facility staff Meet with the health facility supervisor and discuss the findings of the activity. Use the opportunity to review any features of case management for the illness that may help health workers in the facility. Reinforce the importance of immediate reporting and case investigation as tools for prevention of priority diseases and conditions. Use opportunity to emphasize on the need for IPC and minimum PPE Report any suspected cases to the next level Report the suspected cases according to local procedures. Investigate the case further to determine the factors that placed the patient at risk for the disease or condition. Develop an appropriate case response.

The first case was a 25-year old university student with onset of symptoms on 21 March 2012. He was admitted to Neno District hospital on 4 April 2012 after a week of coughing, fever, and shortness of breath. The patient was diagnosed with pneumonia and pericarditis, and he was soon transferred to the coronary care unit (CCU). As his condition worsened, he was transferred to Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital for further treatment; he was intubated in ICU the next day and died on 25 April 2012. Investigators were told that during his illness, the patient was in close contact with his mother (who did not report illness) and two healthcare workers (cases 2 & 3). His illness was later laboratory-confirmed as the novel coronavirus (3). The second case was a 30-year-old male nurse in the CCU at Neno District Hospital. His symptoms started about 29 March 2012. He did not travel or have contact with animals in the 10 days prior to his illness, though he was in close proximity to the first case in the CCU. On 8 April, case 2 was admitted to the CCU at Neno with shortness of breath and pneumonia and was later discharged with no sequelae from Islamic hospital on 23 April. The patient was in close contact with two household members, including his mother (case 13) and a man that did not get sick (who was also the brother of case 3) (3).  Case 3 was a 40-year-old female nurse in the ICU at Neno District Hospital whose illness was laboratory-confirmed after her death. Her symptoms began on 2 April 2012, and she was admitted to Neno District Hospital ICU after developing pneumonia 7 days later. She was later transferred to ICU at Queen Elizabeth Central Hospital where she died on 19 April. During her illness, she was in close contact with 4 household members, including another brother who fell ill 10-days post exposure (case 9), and three others that were not affected. One month prior to her illness, her sister visited from Saudi Arabia (3).  Case 4 was a 65-year-old male doctor whose symptoms of fever and fatigue started 2 April 2012 and developed into pneumonia. The doctor opted to stay home during his illness and soon recovered. He did not travel or have contact with animals in the 10-days prior to his illness. His household members did not report any illness (3).  Cases 5 through 13 occurred in the second phase of the outbreak, with the onset of symptoms occurring between 11th and 26th April, 2012. All except case 13, who was the mother of case 2, had direct contact with one or both laboratory-confirmed cases. None of the healthcare workers travelled or had contact with animals. The healthcare workers reported that they only used gloves when treating patients to avoid stigmatizing them.

Being prepared to detect and respond to such an event is an essential role of the district and national levels.  Preparations to respond to outbreaks and other public health events include:  Establishment of the Public Health Emergency Management Committee (PHEMC) Development of functional Public Health Emergency Operating Centres (PHEOC), that will act as a command and control centre for coordination of public health emergencies or events/incidents at National level, or a similar coordination structure and also at district levels.  Development of policies, plans and procedures for operation, mapping available resources, estimating required supplies, procuring them and conduct simulation exercise to test systems.   Training key members of PHEMC and Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Teams (PHERRT) In addition, having a public health emergency preparedness and response plan (PHEPRP) is crucial. The PHEPRP should include the layout of the coordinating structure, the mapping of risks and how to address and maintain the emergency response plan for relevant events, including the capacity to support operations at primary response level during a public health emergency. The EPR is the overarching plan and should be complemented by a PHEOC plan and event or incident specific plans (ISP). The PHEOC plan guides the operations of the command and coordination centre, outlining standard operating procedures of how each functional area operate and work together; and the ISP is a plan developed to address high priority emergency event based on risk analysis and is always annexed to the EPR plan.  5.1 Establish a permanent public health emergency operations centre (command and control centre) for overseeing public health emergency preparedness and response activities Response to Public Health events is successful if there is a more, coherent, effective and efficient coordination of various actors representing a multi-sectoral team in the context of one heath. This will also ultimately result in minimising the impact of the event in the community. The International Health Regulations (IHR 2005) requires that State Parties develop, strengthen and maintain their capacity to respond promptly and effectively to public health risks and public health emergencies.  Malawi has PHEOC that acts as a command and control centre to enhance coordination and oversees public health emergency preparedness and response activities.  The PHEOC will need to have the following essential elements to be fully functional to support preparation and response to emergencies: Plans and procedures for operations Telecommunication technology and infrastructure to enable timely communication Information system to support informed decision making Trained human resource.  The PHEOC monitors events using various sources of data; facilitates and improves communication between public health and emergency management personnel, and facilitates coordination with multiple response partners. The PHEOC feeds into the National Disaster Risk Management EOC to manage escalated events of national magnitude. It is highly recommended that the PHEOC is positioned at the national and district levels where there are already structures mandating the coordination for public health emergencies. At national level, the PHEOC is placed at PHIM which is answerable to the Secretary for Health.  At district level, it is located at the office of the DHSS who is answerable to the District Commissioner. During public health emergencies, the PHEOC, which is the command and control centre, guided by the National PHEMC is activated and functions as a centre for decision-making, and coordination of information and resources for strategic management of public health events and emergencies. The PHEOC uses the Incident Management System (IMS), which is a standardized approach used to manage and coordinate the response by providing a common hierarchy for response by staff.\\xa0In the context of IDSR, the IMS is represented by Public Health Emergency Management Committee (PHEMC) at strategic level, which will assemble during activation of PHEOC; as well as the National Public Health Emergency Management subcommittees. The IMS outlines the specific roles and responsibilities of responders during an event, while providing a common framework for government, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations to work seamlessly together. In IMS, each person is assigned a specific role and follows a set command structure. It can be staffed with additional teams of subject matter experts, analysts, logisticians, and support staff depending on the situation at that particular time. The operational structure of PHEOC (Command and Control centre) can also be scaled up, which is essential for maintaining the effectiveness of a PHEOC and it can be modular (i.e. can be partially or fully activated) according to situational needs. (Please refer to WHO Framework for a Public Health Emergency Operation Centre) Most importantly, IMS should be functional at all levels of the health system delivery (national, district and health facilities). It is important once the IMS is activated during public health emergencies, the PHEMC regularly meet (at least daily or weekly) to facilitate coordination, communication and information sharing and put in place containment measures and at the same time facilitate the deployment of the PHERRT.  During activation, the PHEOC will also help in the flow of information horizontally and vertically to the respective departments, relevant sectors and partners for smoother relief operations.  Having a centre for command and control is essential for preparedness and response to public health events. If resources allow, districts will need to have PHEOCs, with basic facilities that support direct coordination of preparedness and response to public health emergencies and facilitate real time communication and information between various stakeholders at their levels, but also ensuring there is a mechanism of sharing information with the national level PHEOC. At district level, the PHERRT performs the roles of PHEOC.   When inactive, the PHEOC (Command and Control centre), usually reduces in size, respective members under various Public Health Emergency Response Management Subcommittees return to respective working stations. The few staff remaining at the centre will then liaise with respective sections or departments to continue with maintaining plans and procedures, conducting trainings and simulation exercises, routine and event based surveillance activities, as well as maintaining systematic database of the resources available, important phone numbers, names and addresses of important government and non-government officials, international bodies and NGOs. 5.2 Establish a national and district public health emergency management committee (PHEMC) Public health emergency management committee (PHEMC) should be established at both levels; national and district. The PHEMC across all levels should work closely with their counterparts to plan and monitor the implementation of public health emergency plans. These are the coordinating committees in their respective levels and are composed of technical and non-technical members from health and other sectors. The role of the PHEMC is to develop and oversee the implementation of emergency preparedness and response plan.  The PHEMC can also be known as a policy group. At national level, the PHEMC will provide policy direction in the implementation and operation of the national PHEOC and will also provide an oversight, policy and strategic guidance in the implementation of functional PHEOCs or similar coordination structures or mechanism at district level.  The PHEMC will also mobilise funds for PHEOC development and sustainability. The PHEMC will provide oversight for PHEOC operations and, in the absence of pre-established mutual aid arrangements with other jurisdictions, it may also be the authority that handles requests for external material or financial assistance, particularly in complex, multi-sectoral or multijurisdictional emergencies. 5.2.1 Functions of PHEMC Ensure coordination and integration of surveillance and response activities across all levels  Develop a national/district emergency preparedness and response plan to manage all potential emergencies including disease outbreaks and detection of other emerging public health events or hazards; and clearly stipulate surge capacity to respond to public health emergency at district or national level Map resources available both human and material; experts, logistics including distribution, finance etc.  Periodically review and update the plan in response to any changes in technical, managerial or epidemiological situation or any other risk identified. Liaise with Department of Disaster Management Affairs (DoDMA to ensure a multi-sectoral preparedness and response.  Establish a community communications plan for sharing information with communities before, during, and after any public health emergency. The plan should include mapping of all communication channels-community radio, data on cellular and internet penetration, NGO/FBO networks, prearranged agreements with cellular companies, other platforms (women\\'s groups etc.) that can be leveraged for reaching the public.  The plan should also include liaison activities with relevant partners in multiple sectors including Points of Entry and other required reporting sites. Coordinate community risk mapping activities within the district and ensure all reporting sites are aware of the use of thresholds for reporting acute outbreaks or events. Identify and mobilize resources for emergency prevention and control including procurement of response and communication supplies. There should also be a mechanism to monitor the use of the resources before, during and after the emergency event. Ensure emergency material stockpiles within the district/regional/national are monitored, procured and updated regularly. Enhance linkages with Community Based Surveillance Focal persons to ensure flow of data for early detection of public health events. Coordinate training of community, health facility, and district/national personnel in emergency preparedness and response. Ensure that there is periodic organization of emergency response simulation activities at the national, district and community levels. Coordinate the post-emergency evaluation and plan to disseminate findings with the affected communities. Ensure provision of efficient administrative and financial management support including human resource; cash flow by estimating, tracking and approving response-related expenditure; monitors and coordinates funding from all sources Ensure the facility communication technology and information system is ready to support any type of emergency During, public health emergencies, the PHEMC, at National level, will oversee the activation of the National PHEOC and at district level, they will activate a similar coordination structure. There will also be an activation of the IMS structure i.e. formation of Public Health Emergency Management Subcommittees and the deployment of the Rapid Response Teams. During non-public health emergencies periods, regular meetings should be held to strengthen preparedness capacity (e.g. training health care workers) 5.2.2 Identify members of the Public Health Emergency Management Committees (PHEMC) Organize the PHEMC to include a mix of representatives from the public, non-governmental organizations (NGO) and private sectors to match the functions listed above. For example, in the district level committee, participants from the public sector may include: District Commissioner Officer-In-charge for Police Mayor/Council chairperson Director of Health and Social Services  District Medical Officer  District Animal Health and Livestock Development Officer  Director of Agriculture and Natural resources District Nursing Officer District Disease Control Officer or IDSR Coordinator District Environmental Health Officer  Director of Education District Water Officer  Wildlife Officer  Environmental District Officer Director of Public works Director of Planning and Development Relief and Rehabilitation Officer Laboratory Manager District Community Development Officer District Immigration Officer Health Promotion Officer Magistrate Any other representative from the security organs Influential leaders –for example, chiefs, religious leader, etc.  Note: At national level, an equivalent of the above should be used in order to ensure a more comprehensive multi-sectoral structure. Consider at national level, to include directors from other key relevant ministries, heads of agencies, National Health Research Institutes (Human and Animal). The members from the IHR National Focal Point should always be part of the National Team Composition. From non-governmental organizations with health care activities in the area, include representatives from NGOs and UN organisations. From the private sector, involve participation from: A representative from private health facilities A representative from private laboratories Pharmacists or chemists Representatives of business community Research and training institutions Professional associations Note: The PHEMC should have a chairperson, for example, the District Commissioner or Chief Executive Officer (CEO). 5.2.3 Public Health Emergency Management Committee (PHEMC) meetings When there is no outbreak or any other public health event, the PHEMC should meet regularly, on a monthly or quarterly basis, in order to:  Regularly review the national/district public health emergency preparedness and response plan  Exchange information on risk monitoring. It should be emphasized that other relevant health sectors can equally benefit from information provided by the human health sector and vice versa. In some events, human cases can be the first indication of a threat to other sectors. For example, animal health services will be impacted by cases of Crimean- Congo haemorrhagic fever, as cases in humans constitute the primary indicator for viral circulation in animals as infection is asymptomatic in livestock, as such intervention must be done at this sector. For instance, vaccination among livestock might be crucial if detection of human cases of anthrax or rift valley fever have initially occurred as signal for asymptomatic diseases among animals.  Review disease trends and updates on preparedness steps Review the level of preparedness at the beginning of each epidemic season (e.g. before the start of the cholera season)  Monitor stocks of equipment for event investigation and response Share conclusions and recommendations of these meetings with respective committees at all levels.  Organize simulation exercises/drills to test the effectiveness and efficiency of the EPR plans It should be noted that the PHEOC (Command and Control centre) if already established will serve as a hub for coordinating these activities. If not, a similar coordination structure or mechanism will serve the same purpose. During an emergency or outbreak response, the PHEMC should: Meet as soon as the outbreak or event is established Conduct situational analysis and grade the level of the event  At national level, activate the PHEOC (Command and Control centre) or similar coordinating structures at district level and deploy PHERRT to the field to investigate and respond to the event. Assess the need for, and request support from higher level when needed, for example, a district will request for support from the national EPR or Rapid Response Teams when necessary. Meet at least daily at the beginning of an outbreak or event and weekly as the response continues. Regularly review the outbreak response and take action to improve outbreak control actions as indicated. Document and communicate outbreak response actions to next higher level Conduct an after-action review. 5.3 Establish Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Teams at all levels A Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Team (PHERRT) is a technical, multi-disciplinary team that is readily available for quick mobilisation and deployment in case of emergencies to effectively investigate and respond to emergencies and public health events that presents significant harm to humans, animals and environment irrespective of origin or source. The PHERRT should be established at the district and national levels. Refer to section 4.2 on the composition of the PHERRT. Roles and responsibilities of the national and district PHERRT Investigate rumours and reported outbreaks, verify diagnosis and other public health emergencies including laboratory testing Collect additional samples from new patients and old ones if necessary (human, animals, food, and water, environment)  Make a follow up by visiting and interviewing exposed individuals, establish a case definition and work with community to find additional cases Assist in laying out mechanisms for implementation of Infection Preventive Control measures Assist in generating a line list of the cases, and perform descriptive analysis of data (Person, Place and Time) to generate hypothesis including planning for a further analytical study Propose appropriate strategies and control measures including risk communications activities Establish appropriate and coordinated risk communication system through a trained spokesperson Coordinate rapid response actions with national and local authorities, partners and other agencies.  Initiate the implementation of the proposed control measures including capacity building Conduct ongoing monitoring and evaluation of effectiveness of control measures through continuous epidemiological analysis of the outbreak or public health event  Conduct risk assessments to determine if the outbreak is a potential PHEIC  Prepare detailed investigation reports to share with PHEMC Contribute to ongoing preparedness assessments and the final evaluation of any outbreak response.  Meet daily during outbreaks, and quarterly when there is no outbreak Participate in simulation exercises 5.4 Risk mapping for outbreaks and other public health events Vulnerability, risk assessment and mapping is used as an aid to preparedness to identify at-risk areas or populations, rank preparedness activities, and also to engage key policy and operational partners.   This includes mapping and assessing risks (in the catchment area) with the potential to affect community health. This mapping must address all acute health risks, and not be restricted to communicable diseases. The exercise should consider the identification and mapping across all levels from national through district to health facilities. For example, include evaluation of drinking water sources or food storage methods and animal breeding areas and movements. This process should be ongoing and updated periodically. For example, once a year, assess those risks and record the information on a map. This is useful information when considering supplies, transport and other resource issues necessary for the response.  Malawi uses WHO Strategic Tool for Assessing Risks (STAR), which is a tool used to assess a wide range of hazards including the health consequences of natural or human-induced emergencies, the health events covered under IHR (zoonosis, chemical, radio-nuclear, food safety) and also events occurring in neighbouring countries or regions. The tool will assist the district or national level to develop priorities for the development of contingency plans and specific responses, and also can be used to outline the potential needs to enhance national capacity in terms of preparedness and response (Strategic Tool for Assessing Risks, STAR, WHO, DRAFT Version 3.3.1 (2017/07/27). The country also uses the 2008 Tripartite \"Zoonotic Diseases: A Guide to Establishing Collaboration between Animal and Human Health Sectors at the Country Level\", which was updated in 2019 (https://www.oie.int/doc/ged/D12060.PDF). 5.5 Resource Mapping In preparing for outbreaks, there is need to undertake resource mapping to identify the available resources in every geographical area. This ensures prompt mobilization and distribution of such resources including material and human resources in an outbreak situation. Some of the resources can also be obtained from other sectors in the district or development partners and NGO available in respective levels 5.6 Prepare an emergency preparedness and response plan There should be all hazard plans developed for preparedness and response for national and district levels. The plans at all levels should be in line with the overarching national preparedness and response plan for health sector and consistent with the overall national policies, plans and emergency management principles.  The purpose of this plan is to strengthen the ability of the national to district levels to respond promptly when an outbreak or other public health event is detected. This plan should: Be based on risk assessments done in a multi-sectoral approach, and should specify the resources available for emergency preparedness and response.  Take into consideration diseases with epidemic potential in the country, district, and neighbouring countries. Take into account all other events (All hazard approach) and cover the IHR core capacity requirements of Annex 2A for surveillance and response (IHR 2005, Third edition) Take into account Point of Entry activities for strengthening surveillance and response Lay out concept of operations (CONOPS) including clear lines of accountability, decision making authorities and processes, procedures for activation /deactivation, call for assistance etc. Describe the surge capacity to respond to public health emergencies of national, and district concern Provide estimates of the population at risk for epidemic-prone diseases and other public health emergencies. Clearly indicate for each suspected outbreak which reference laboratory will be used for confirmation. Provide estimates of needed quantities of medicines, vaccines, supplies, laboratory reagents, and consumables for each epidemic-prone disease likely to occur. Identify training needs, and develop a training plan for all staff including Rapid Response Teams Describe the procedures, plans to relocate or mobilize resources to support response  Describe the procedures for risk communication Be tested before implementation and periodically through simulation exercises. Note: The plan should also include how to institutionalize health facility and community resilience building, and preventive interventions based on risk analysis and mapping.

Mapping of hotspots  5.6.1 Set up contingency stocks of medicines, vaccines, reagents and supplies Outbreaks and other public health emergencies require the rapid mobilization of resources such as vaccines, medicines and lab supplies. It is prudent to map out resources available so as to get the status of the stockpile with respect to pharmaceuticals, Personal Protective Equipment (PPE) and other equipment to establish and preposition stockpiles of materials before an emergency occurs. While doing the mapping at national level for stockpiling, it is also important to know the global stockpile of various items which can be tapped into during an outbreak.  As follow up to the public health risk assessment activity, each level from districts to national level should set up a contingency stock of medicines, vaccines, reagents and supplies to permit prompt management of the first cases without delay. For district level, this is critical before support arrives from higher levels. Ensure that, there are also quick mechanisms of sending supplies from central level. Also, regularly and carefully monitor the contingency stock in order to avoid shortages and expiry of medicines, vaccines, reagents and supplies. Examples of stock management tools are included in the Annex 5A at the end of this section. The content of the contingency stock varies with the nature of epidemic-prone diseases and the risk of outbreak in the district. Risk assessment activities help to develop a list of minimum materials that should be stockpiled at the district and community levels.  If not, all districts and community levels can be stockpiled with minimum materials, ensure a designated point (health centre, district) is identified to ensure quick release of these items when needed during an outbreak.  Partnerships with other implementing agencies, such as NGOs, concerning stockpiles of appropriate medicines and vaccines and other materials should be established in advance, at both levels (national and district) 5.6.2 Conduct stock management for outbreak response Maintain and preposition adequate supplies and materials for responding to an outbreak or public health event before an outbreak occurs. These supplies should be stored in safe and adequate conditions as required for each relevant supply. Use an inventory checklist such as the one in Annex 5B to assess which supplies are already available for use during a response activity. If the supplies are already available, determine if they can be set aside for use during a response. If they are not available, can they be purchased or requested through the national system for procurement? Periodically, for example, every 3 months, make sure the supplies are in good condition and ready to be used and mechanisms to assess them readily are available.  At a minimum, carry out the following tasks (relevant to each level) to estimate necessary supplies, inventory what is available, and plan to procure essential items for use in response: List all required items for carrying out surveillance, laboratory and response necessary for detecting and responding to priority diseases, conditions and events. Consider: Availability of case definition posters; registers including line list register; as well as required reporting forms/referral forms. Availability of laboratory reagents and supplies and diagnostic reagents and kits,  Availability of specimen collection, storage and transporting kits including Triple Package containers, Availability of various guidelines for surveillance and response of specific diseases including laboratory SOPs Availability of case management guidelines, medicines, supplies and other field intervention materials Make an inventory and note the quantity of each item that is available. Complete and regularly update a stock balance sheet for each item. Observe expiry dates and practice best logistical practices for packing, shipping, storing and disposing of supplies and materials. Establish a critical or minimum quantity for each item that would need to be on hand for an investigation or response activity. Consider logistic and epidemiologic factors in establishing minimum quantities. Monitor the stock balances against the critical quantity established. Report regularly on the IDSR stock situation. See Annex 5C for an example of a stock item transaction and balance sheet. 5.6.3 Update human resource available for response as well as other logistics support for response to outbreaks or public health events at all levels Update yearly list of all surveillance focal persons from all reporting sites including community level Update roster of rapid response teams Update other logistics like vehicles, fuel, phone cards etc. Update list of trained health staff including veterinary staff Map laboratories that have sufficient quality control standards and meet the required standards to ensure reliable results, including availability of SOP which defines biosafety procedures for collecting, packaging, labelling, shipping, manipulating and discarding samples. Map also the specimen referral/transportation network including schedules, and if not create the mechanism to ensure prompt referral of specimen is done once an outbreak is suspected Designate isolation wards for the management of patients with highly infectious diseases including contact details, location, bed capacity, level of expertise, and type of patients/diseases that can be treated Develop a patient referral system for highly infectious diseases, including transportation mechanisms Take stock of risk communication SOPs at different levels  5.7 Annexes to Section 5 Annex 5A:

This section describes steps for declaring an outbreak and activating the response structures, conducting a public health response and providing general directions for immediate response actions for leading causes of illness, death and disability. Consult relevant WHO guidelines which are at the end of this section, for responding to chemical, biological and radio-nuclear events.  When an outbreak, acute public health event or condition is detected, an investigation should take place to determine the cause of the outbreak as described in Section 4. The results of the investigation should guide the response. Most disease prevention and control programs implement successful response actions such as conducting a mass immunization campaign for a vaccine-preventable disease, strengthening nutritional support and feeding practices for children with malnutrition, or administering anti-malarial, antibiotic or antiviral treatments as indicated. Successful responses are carried out with community involvement and often include social and behaviour change component.  Effective coordination of response activities is also critical, as many actors/stakeholders will be involved. It is essential that all actors/stakeholders be identified in advance including their areas of support, roles and responsibilities to enable smooth response during an epidemic or any other public health event. This is the role of the PHEMC, which through the activation of the PHEOC, they will ensure effective coordination of the response activities across different sectors and donors (as discussed in Section 5). Regardless of the specific recommended response, the national or district’s role in selecting and implementing a recommended response is essential for safe-guarding the health and well-being of communities in the respective level. Under the International Health Regulations IHR (2005), districts are required to be involved in response to hazards such as infectious diseases, zoonosis, food safety, chemical, radio-nuclear and other unknown events if they are detected. 6.1 Declaring an outbreak and activating the response structures Once an epidemic threshold is reached at district level, the Director of Health and Social Services should notify the Public Health Institute of Malawi (PHIM). Depending on the event, at the national level, the PHIM, and the IHR NFP will assess whether the event is a potential Public Health Event of International Concern (PHEIC) using the International Health Regulations (IHR) decision instrument. The NFP through the director of PHIM will report to the Secretary for Health to notify the WHO IHR AFRO Office. They will then alert the nearby districts about the outbreak for coordinated response efforts. While waiting for confirmation of laboratory diagnosis there may be a declaration of an outbreak by the Minister of Health or respective sector ministry 6.2 Mobilize Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Teams (PHERRT) for immediate action The Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Teams (PHERRT) would have already been identified during preparedness activities. Mobilize the teams and make sure that the membership of the team reflects the technical needs of the response. Refer to Section 5 of these guidelines for recommendations on the composition of the rapid response team and the team’s roles and responsibilities. 6.2.1 Convene the District Public Health Emergency Management committee (DPHEMC) Once an outbreak or event is confirmed, the District Health Management Team (DHMT) will work with the District Commissioner or Chief Executive Officer to convene the PHEMC to assess and implement the response. They will also activate the IMS (Refer to Section 5). The following further steps should take place: Request outbreak or event response funds to be released. Alert neighbouring districts within and outside the country about the outbreak. If they are reporting a similar outbreak, coordinate response efforts with them. If there is an already established cross-border surveillance and response framework with neighbouring country, then inform the neighbouring district in a given country. If not, the IHR NFP must communicate with the neighbouring NFP to notify them of the outbreak and public health event. This will assist in coordination of response to a public health event and minimize spread of the disease beyond the catchment area. Assign clear responsibilities for specific response activities to lead the technical committee. They will also review if the IMS team is adequately composed i.e. has all the technical and non-technical members (See Section 5) Provide orientation or training along with adequate supplies of relevant supplies for the district response team and affected health facility staff. Review existing resources as defined in the preparedness plan and determine what additional resources are required.  For example, consider: Human resources that could be mobilized to manage the epidemic Funds to support response activities Other logistic support e.g. vehicles and fuel, phones Request emergency stocks or Personal Protective Equipment (PPE), disinfection, and required medicines and other medical supplies such as specimen transport kits Provide laboratory or diagnostic support for confirmation of pathogens responsible for the epidemics. If the district does not have the capacity to safely collect, package and ship the specimen, contact the reference laboratory for assistance. For laboratories where referral of specimen is a challenge, consider using Rapid Diagnostic kits or any other Point of Care (PoC) Diagnostics if available.  Mobilize logistics support (travel of rapid response team, accommodation arrangement, communication, other essential equipment) to district and community level.   If supplies are not available locally: Contact the central levels to request alternate suppliers Collaborate with other services, activities, or non-governmental organizations or private pharmacies/laboratories in your area Identify practical low-cost substitutes Ensure clear lines of communication and appoint a spokesperson. 6.3 Select and implement appropriate public health response activities Review investigation results and data analysis interpretation provided by Public Health Emergency Rapid Response Team (PHERRT) to select appropriate response activities to contain the confirmed outbreak or public health event. Regardless of the specific causes of the outbreak or event, the success of the response relies on the activation of the IMS and at the same time implementing intervention strategies such as; Overall coordination Case management and Infection, Prevention and Control (IPC)  Logistics and supply chain management Laboratory or diagnostic, surveillance and epidemiology Social mobilization, risk communication and community engagement Reactive vaccination Water, Sanitation and Hygiene (WASH) Vector control Refer to Section 11 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines and national disease specific guidelines to select response activities, which involve: Proven measures to prevent unnecessary deaths or disabilities due to the specific cause of the problem. A mix of activities for immediately controlling the problem in the short-term, and reducing the risk of ongoing transmission in the long-term through prevention activities. Participation from the community, health care facilities and the district personnel. Participation of other key actors/stakeholders from private organizations, business entity association groups, traditional healers, food vendor associations and others who might influence the response activities. Response activities for particular outbreaks or public health problems or events may include the following: Manage cases Conduct emergency vaccination campaigns, when recommended for humans or animals Provide relevant chemoprophylaxis and vaccination for health workers Improve access to clean water Improve safe disposal of human and animal waste Improve food handling practices Reduce exposure to mosquitoes and other vectors Control of vectors Involve other experts (socio anthropologists, social scientists) Enhance specific surveillance measures at Point of Entry Enhance social and behavioural change activities Strengthen media and public communication (press, radio, TV, social media, etc.) Implementing a response means carrying out the operational steps so the actions take place as planned. Regardless of the specific causes of the outbreak or event, the success of the response relies on the success of general factors such as management (treatment and monitoring of patients for adverse events particularly if experimental medicines or vaccines are used) and appropriate IPC, provision of supplies, and availability of trained health staff.  The selected activities for responding to outbreaks or public health events include the following: Strengthen case management and infection prevention and control measures Build the capacity for response staff Enhance surveillance during the response Enhance surveillance in neighbouring border district Engage Community during response Inform and educate the community Conduct a mass vaccination campaign Improve access to clean and safe water Ensure safe disposal of infectious waste Improve food handling practices Reduce exposures to infectious or environmental hazards Ensure safe and dignified burial and handling of dead bodies  Ensure appropriate and adequate logistics and supplies 6.3.1 Strengthen case management and Infection Prevention and Control measures (IPC) Take steps to support improved clinical practices in the district. Review the recommendations in Annex 6A and Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines for treating cases of different diseases during an outbreak.  Train and equip health workers at the district level to undertake the following measures: Ensure that clinicians receive results of laboratory confirmation where necessary. Ensure health workers record all patients in a recognizable standardized register and a line list In an epidemic involving a large number of cases, ask the in-charge at each health facility to identify an area that can be used to accommodate a large number of patients. Provide Standard Operating Procedures (SOP) that includes IPC guidelines Implement IPC and risk mitigation measures, for example: Establish triage and isolation wards for highly infectious diseases (Ebola, Cholera, SARS, etc.). See Annex 6H for cholera treatment centre. Ensure health staffs have access to safety and personal protective equipment for any infectious diseases (especially for Ebola and SARS). Ensure that there are safe practices and protection of non-health worker (supporting staff, e.g. security, cleaners, administrative staff) Assess and assure WASH standards for health facilities.  Provide oversight about disposal of PPE and other contaminated supplies. Ensure appropriate biosafety and biosecurity for animals (farms, markets, etc.). Ensure the necessary medicines and treatment supplies are available. Ensure that the proper treatment protocols are available Review the standard operating procedures for the referral system. Ensure that a proper discharge protocol of cases linked to social workers is available. 6.3.2\\tBuild the capacity for response staff Provide relevant capacity building opportunities for response staff on the outbreak or event case definition, case management procedures, reporting process and required data elements. It is essential that members of the PHERRT are aware of and have access to any indicated personal protection equipment and IPC practices indicated by the disease involved in the response. If there are immunizations requirements for responding to the particular disease or condition, ensure that members of PHERRT are protected with indicated immunizations. To reinforce the skills of response staff: Give clear and concise directions to health workers and other staff taking part in the response. Select topics for orientation or training. Emphasize case management and infection prevention and control for the specific disease according to disease specific recommendations. Select other training topics depending on the risk of exposure to the specific public health hazard for example: Case management protocols for cases Enhancing standard precautions (use of clean running water, hand-washing and safe disposal of sharps) Barrier nursing and use of PPEs Isolation precautions Treatment protocols such as delivering oral rehydration salts (ORS) and using intravenous fluids Disinfecting surfaces, clothing and equipment Safe disposal of bodies and dignified burials Safe disposal of animal carcasses Others which may seem necessary and may include, among others, client-patient interactions and counselling skills etc. 3. Conduct orientation and training Orient or re-orient the district PHEMC, PHERRT, other health and non-health personnel on epidemic management based on the current epidemic. In an urgent situation, there is often no time for formal training. Provide on-the-job training as needed. Make sure there is an opportunity for the mentor to observe the trainees using the updated or new skill. Monitor participant performance and review skills as needed 6.3.3 Enhance surveillance during the response During a response to an outbreak, health staff at all health facilities must be vigilant in surveillance of the disease, condition or events, by liaising with the community health worker or any person identified as community focal person. For example, members of the response teams and health staff in affected facilities should; Search for additional persons who have the specific disease and refer them to the health facility or treatment centres, or if necessary quarantine the household, manage the patient and ensure they have access to consistent/adequate food, water, and non-food items (i.e. soap, chlorine, firewood, medicines, sanitary pads, etc.)  Ensure timely provision of laboratory information to the team Update the line list, make data analysis by time (epi-curve), person (age and sex) and place (mapping of cases). Monitor the effectiveness of the outbreak response activity. Report daily at the beginning of the epidemic. Once the epidemic progresses, the district PHEMC can decide on a different frequency of reporting. Actively trace and follow up contacts as indicated (See Section 4 for how to do contact tracing). 6.3.4 Enhance surveillance with neighbouring border districts During response, it is important also to work closely with neighbouring districts to ensure the outbreak does not spill to another district. It is important to share information and also plan for joint surveillance and response activities.  Initiate the establishment of the cross-border disease surveillance and response committees to provide a platform for sharing surveillance data, epidemiological and other related information during the outbreak. The committee should draw membership from both neighbouring districts and the composition should include at least: IDSR Coordinator, The Laboratory Manager,  The Director of Health and Social Services The District Commissioner The Police-Officer-In-Charge The District Environmental Health Officer The District Medical Officer The focal person responsible for animal (domestic and/or wildlife) health and local immigration officials.  The committee can also co-opt other members depending on the disease profile and the disease outbreak/public health emergency they are handling.  During the emergencies, the committee will meet as soon as a public health emergency is identified and then weekly or fortnightly as it continues. The committee will continue to hold routine quarterly meetings during the inter-epidemic period to review disease trends, other early warning systems, and their districts’ level of preparedness. 6.3.5 Engage Community during response Community-Based Surveillance Focal Persons (See Definition in Introduction section) can be the first responders and take steps to make the situation as safe as possible for the community. Some of the actions include the following: Engage and inform community leaders with information on the situation and actions that can be taken to mitigate the situation Provide first aid and call or send for medical help.  Keep people away from a ‘risk’ area (potentially contaminated water source). Respectfully isolate anyone with a potentially infectious disease paying particular attention to cultural sensitivities.  Quarantine for animals, market closures, etc. Provide community education including specific actions the community can take to protect themselves. Engage in IPC and hygiene promotion in coordination with any efforts at strengthening the availability of materials/infrastructure for IPC and hygiene. Identify local effective channels for delivery of the information to the community; Organize door-to-door campaigns utilizing trusted individuals to reach every household within the catchment area to promote the prevention of the spread of the public health event and to encourage self-reporting, treatment and early health-seeking behaviour among people who have had contact with the public health event or are suspected to be public health event cases and events. Engage community members as stakeholders and problem solvers, not merely beneficiaries 6.3.6 Inform and educate the community Effective risk communication is an essential element of managing public health events. It is a cross cutting activity that can impact other technical areas of the response such as WASH, vaccination, community surveillance, etc. It is also essential to create trust between first responders and the community. When the public is at risk of a real or potential health threat, treatment options may be limited, direct interventions may take time to organize, and resources may be few. Communicating advice and guidance, therefore, may be the most important public health tool in managing a risk. Keep the public informed to calm their fears and encourage cooperation with the response efforts. Develop community education messages with information about recognizing the illness, how to prevent transmission and when to seek treatment. Begin communication activities with the community as soon as an epidemic or public health problem is identified. Identify community groups, local NGO or outreach teams that can help gather information and amplify the messages. Ensure consistency in content of messaging between all messengers (community leaders, health care personnel, religious leaders, etc.). The following should be considered for effective risk communication, social mobilisation and community engagement; Decide what to communicate by referring to disease specific recommendations in Section 11.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines. Make sure to include: Signs and symptoms of the disease How to treat the disease at home, if home treatment is recommended, and how to prepare disinfectant solutions. Prevention behaviours that are feasible and that have a high likelihood of preventing disease transmission When to come to the health facility for evaluation and treatment Immunization recommendations, if any. At the same time, keep active processes of collection of qualitative information coming in to establish what rumours are circulating so that they can be addressed.  2.  Decide how to state the message. Make sure that the messages: Are in local terminology Are culturally sensitive and acceptable Are clear and concise Consider local traditions Address beliefs about the disease. NB: Consider pre-testing the messages from similar settings before dissemination.  Sample community education messages are in Annex 6F at the end of this section. 3. Select appropriate communication methods that are present in your district. For example, Mass media, (radio, television, newspapers) Meetings (health personnel, community, religious, opinion and political leaders) Educational and communication materials (posters, fliers) Multi-media presentations (for example, films, video or narrated slide presentations) at the markets, health centres, schools, women’s and other community groups, service organizations, religious centres. Social media (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.) Community drama groups/play groups Public address system  Cooperate/ Institutional website Email/ SMS subscriptions Give health education messages to community groups and service organizations and ask that they disseminate them during their meetings. Give health education messages to trusted and influential community leaders and ask them to transmit to the community. Designated person from the MoH should serve as spokesperson to the media. Tell the media the name of the spokesperson, and that all information about the outbreak will be provided by the spokesperson.  Release information to the media only through the spokesperson to make sure that the community receives clear and consistent information.  On a regular basis,  the Director of Health and Social Services should interact with the community leaders to give:  Frequent, up-to-date information on the outbreak and response  Clear and simple health messages for the media  Clear instructions to communicate to the media the information and health education messages from the PHEMC 6.3.7 Conduct a mass vaccination campaign Collaborate with the national Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) program managers to conduct a mass vaccination campaign, if indicated. Develop or update a micro plan for the mass vaccination campaign as soon as possible.  Determine the target population for the activity based on the case and outbreak investigation results (refer to EPI program guidelines for specific recommendations about delivery of the indicated vaccines). A worksheet called “Planning a mass vaccination campaign” is in Annex 6C at the end of this section. A worksheet called “estimating vaccine supplies for vaccination activities” in Annex 6D at the end of this section.  Annex 6E describes recommended vaccination practices during vaccination campaigns. 6.3.8 Improve access to clean and safe water Containers that are used for storage of drinking water can be the vehicle for disease outbreaks including cholera, typhoid, Shigella and Hepatitis A and E. Ensure the community has an adequate supply of clean and safe water for drinking and other uses. The daily water needs per person during non-outbreak situations are shown below. Water needs are much higher during an outbreak situation, especially outbreaks of diarrhoeal diseases. Table 6.1: Water Basic quantity needs calculations Daily water needs per person*\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Non-outbreak situation\\ufdd0During outbreak of diarrhoeal disease\\ufdd0Home use\\ufdd020 litres per day\\ufdd050 litres\\ufdd0Health care setting\\ufdd040 to 60 litres per day\\ufdd050 litres in wards 100 litres in surgery 10 litres in kitchen **Refugee Health: An Approach to Emergency Situations, Medecins sans Frontieres, 1997 MacMillan Safe sources of drinking water include: Piped chlorinated water Chlorination at point-of-use to ensure safe drinking water Protected water sources (for example, closed wells with a cover, boreholes, protected springs, rain water collected in a clean container) Boiled water from any source. If no local safe water sources are available during an emergency, water supply may need to be brought from outside. To make sure that families have safe and clean drinking water at home (even if the source is safe) provide: Community education on how to keep home drinking water safe. Refer to Annex 6F for sample community messages and references to specific prevention guidelines for preparing safe water at home. Containers that prevent contamination of water. For example, provide containers with narrow mouths so that people cannot contaminate the water by putting their hands into the container. Sites for waste disposal including faeces should at least be 30 metres or more away from sources of water. 6.3.9 Ensure safe disposal of infectious waste To make sure that human excreta are disposed safely to avoid secondary infections due to contact with contaminated substances: Assign teams to inspect local areas for human and animal waste disposal. Safe practices include disposing of faeces in a latrine or burying them in the ground more than 10 metres from water supply. If unsafe practices are found such as open defecation, provide information to the community about safe disposal of the waste. Construct latrines appropriate for local conditions with the cooperation of the community Conduct effective community education on sanitation practices. 6.3.10 Improve food handling practices Make sure that people in the home, in restaurants, at food vending settings, and in factories handle food safely. Refer to the nationally established standards and controls for the handling and processing of food. To ensure food safety and hygiene: Conduct community education on food hygiene practices for the general public and those in the food industry. Visit restaurants, food vendors, food packaging factories, and so on to inspect food-handling practices. Look for safe practices such as proper hand-washing facilities, cleanliness and adherence to national standards. Close restaurants, vending areas or factories if inspection results show unsafe food handling practices. Strengthen national controls for food safety and hygiene as necessary. 6.3.11 Reduce exposures to infectious or environmental hazards As indicated by the outbreak or event, take action to reduce exposure to hazards or factors contributing to the outbreak or event. This may involve chemical, physical or biological agents. Technical requirements for reducing exposure will be determined according to national policy and through collaboration with those who have experience in these areas. For example, occupational or industrial exposure to heavy metals (for example, lead) will require coordination with multiple ministries and partners. Community education and behaviour change interventions can be supportive in engaging the community to affect changes that will limit exposure to dangerous levels of chemicals and other hazards. For vector-borne diseases, engage the service of experts such as an entomologist in designing appropriate interventions that will reduce exposure to the offending vectors (for example, for anopheles mosquito borne-illness) work with the malaria control program in your district to: Promote indoor residual spraying program  Conduct community education on the proper use of bed nets and how to avoid dusk-to-dawn mosquito bites. Promote the use of locally available LLINs and other insecticide treated materials (bed nets, blankets, clothes, sheets, curtains, etc.) Encourage environmental cleanliness e.g. removing stagnant water, clear bushes etc. For diseases spread by rodents, work with the Environmental Health Officer (responsible for Vectors and Vermins) in your district to encourage the community to: Avoid contact with rodents and their urine, droppings and other secretions Keep food and water in the home covered to prevent contamination by rodents Keep the home and cooking area clean and tidy to reduce possibilities of rodents nesting in the room. Use chemicals (insecticides, rodenticides, larvicides etc.) and traps as appropriate based on environmental and entomological assessment. Educate community on personal protection to reduce exposure 6.3.12 Ensure safe and dignified burial and handling of dead bodies  Dead body management forms a critical role in combating the spread of infectious diseases both as a part of case detection and surveillance as well as managing potentially infectious material. Viral Haemorrhagic Fever (VHF), cholera and unexplained deaths in suspicious circumstances are situations that require careful handling of bodies. It is also essential to dispose of bodies in a safe and dignified manner by trained personnel due to the infectiousness of an epidemic prone disease. The disinfection or decontamination of homes and hospital wards (where corpses of persons who died of an infectious disease) should be implemented.  A guide should be followed to ensure proper disinfection or decontamination of homes and hospitals where there are corpses of suspected infectious disease.  Dead body management guidelines distinguish between high and low priority/risk bodies, utilizing burial team that have been trained. Deaths that are considered high risk may be treated as a form of surveillance and case detection for VHF or possibly other conditions when relevant testing capabilities are available.  Safe burials can be conducted in the community at approved burial sites at the discretion of the families. The PHEMC may direct to develop a safe and dignified burial contingency plan when an infectious disease outbreak occurs and such plan will be reviewed periodically to address the evolution of the epidemic.  6.3.13 Ensure appropriate and adequate logistics and supplies A dedicated logistic team is needed during an outbreak response.  Throughout the outbreak, monitor the effectiveness of the logistics system and delivery of essential supplies and materials.  Carry out logistical planning to make sure transport is used in the most efficient ways.  Monitor the reliability of communication between teams during the outbreak and if additional equipment is needed (for example, additional minutes for mobile phones), take action to provide teams what they need to carry out the response actions. Monitoring the implementation of the outbreak or event is key for outbreak control. The monitoring results will be important for including in the report of response to supervisory levels, to community leaders and for future advocacy. For example, make sure there is ongoing monitoring of: Disease trends in order to assess the effectiveness of the response measures, the extension of the epidemic and risk factors Effectiveness of the response: case fatality rate, incidence Implementation of the response: program coverage, meetings of the PHEMC Availability and use of adequate resources, supplies and equipment Community acceptability of response efforts  Regular reporting on stocks of supplies provided during emergencies 6.4 Provide regular situation reports on the outbreak and events Periodically, report on the progress of the outbreak response (refer to Annex 6G). Provide information developed by the PHEMC to the affected communities and health facilities. In the situation updates, provide information such as: Details on the response activities. Include dates, places, and individuals involved in each activity. Also include the “Epi” curve, spot map, table of person analyses, and the line list of cases Any changes that were made since the last report Effectiveness of the response: case fatality rate, incidence  Implementation of the response of the EPR committee etc.  Operational challenges and gaps Recommended changes to improve epidemic response in the future such as a vaccination strategy to make the vaccination activity more effective or a transporting procedure for laboratory specimens to allow specimens to quickly reach the reference laboratory in good condition. The situation reports will be an important reference for evaluating the response and developing a final report. A suggested format of the report is in Annex 7B of Section 7. Steps for monitoring and evaluating a response are in Section 8 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines. 6.5 Document the response  During an outbreak and also at the end, the district health management team should: Collect all the documents including minutes of the meeting, activity, process, epidemic report, evaluation report and other relevant documents. Prepare a coversheet listing of all the above documents. Document lessons learned and recommended improvements and update Country EPR plan, event/disease specific plan and other relevant SOPs and Tools in line with these where appropriate (After Action Review - AAR). This will become an essential source of data for evaluating the response. Refer to section 8 of the 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines, on how to monitor, evaluate, supervise and provide feedback on IDSR activities. 6.6 Annexes to Section 6 Annex 6A: \\tTreat cases during an outbreak Annex 6B:\\tPreparing disinfectant solutions from ordinary household products Annex 6C: \\tPlanning an emergency immunization campaign Annex 6D: \\tEstimating vaccine supplies for immunization activities Annex 6E: \\tRecommended immunization practices Annex 6F: \\tSample messages for community education Annex 6G: \\tOutbreak communication Annex 6H: \\tKey IPC Measures Annex\\xa06I:\\tResponse to chemical and radio-nuclear events Annex 6A: Treat cases during an outbreak Use appropriate medicines and treatments for managing cases during an outbreak.

(Plan A) Plan C. Intravenous therapy for severe dehydration Severe dehydration is a medical emergency and patients must be treated urgently.  Seconds can make a difference. Patients with severe dehydration should start intravenous fluids (IV) immediately. As soon as the patient can drink, also give ORS solution 5ml/kg/hour simultaneously Ringer’s lactate is the first choice out of all the IV fluids. If Ringer’s lactate is not available other sterile solutions can be an alternative: normal saline 5% glucose in normal saline Cholera saline (containing Na+, 133; K+, 20; Cl-, 98; acetate, 48 mmol/L)  Plain 5% glucose (dextrose) solution is not recommended.  Give a total of 100 ml/kg Ringer’s Lactate Solution divided into two periods as indicate below: Age\\ufdd0First period\\ufdd0Second period\\ufdd0Total\\ufdd0< 1 year\\ufdd030 ml/kg in 1 hour\\ufdd070ml/kg in 5 hours\\ufdd0100 ml/kg in 6 hours\\ufdd0≥ 1 year and adults\\ufdd030 ml/kg in 30 min\\ufdd070 ml/kg in 2 1/2 hours\\ufdd0100 ml/kg in 3 hours More than one IV line may be necessary to give the first bolus treatment.   When IV rehydration is not possible and the patient can’t drink, ORS solution can be given by nasogastric tube.  Do not use nasogastric tubes for patients who are unconscious or vomiting. When possible, fluid output should be measured and equivalent volumes added to the amount described for initial treatment. Monitor the patient closely and perform frequent reassessment (every 15-30 min). If hydration is not improving, give the IV drip more rapidly. 200ml/kg or more may be needed during the first 24 hours of treatment. After 6 hours (infants) or 3 hours (older patients), perform a full reassessment. Switch to ORS solution if hydration is improved and the patient can drink. Complications – pulmonary oedema can occur if excessive IV fluid has been given; renal failure if too little IV fluid is given; and hypoglycaemia and hypokalaemia in children with malnutrition rehydrated with Ringer lactate only. Rehydration must be closely monitored by the medical staff. Antibiotic treatment The laboratory should be asked about patterns of resistance of the strain at the beginning of and during the outbreak and adapt the treatment accordingly.  Antibiotics should be given only in severe cases, to reduce the duration of symptoms and carriage of the pathogen.  Antibiotics are given as soon as the patient is able to take oral medication (once vomiting has stopped): Doxycycline: single dose (300mg for adults; 2-4 mg/kg for a child between 1 and 14 years of age), is antibiotic of choice for all patients, including pregnant women. If resistance to doxycycline, azithromycin (1 g orally as a single dose for adults and 20 mg/kg (max 1g) orally as a single dose for children < 12 years. \\ufdd0First-line\\ufdd0Alternative\\ufdd0Adults (including pregnant women)\\ufdd0Doxycycline 300 mg as a single dose\\ufdd0Azithromycin PO 1g as a single dose\\ufdd0Children < 12 years old\\ufdd0Doxycycline 2-4 mg/kg single dose\\ufdd0Azithromycin PO 20mg/kg single dose\\ufdd0Zinc supplementation for children \\u2029Zinc supplementation in the management of children 6 months to 5 years with watery diarrhoea reduces the frequency and severity of the episode as well as the frequency of subsequent diarrhoea. When available, supplementation (20 mg zinc per day) should be started immediately Plan B. Oral rehydration for patients with some dehydration   Patients presenting with some signs of dehydration must be admitted to the CTC/CTU. Initial treatment; give ORS according the weight of the patient (75ml/kg in the first 4 hours).  Cholera patients with some signs of dehydration do not need IV fluid replacement, but they need to be monitored closely during the first 4 hours: If at any time signs of severe dehydration appear then shift immediately to Treatment Plan C If there are still some signs of dehydration after the first 4 hours, repeat Treatment Plan B for 4 hours and reassess If there are no signs of dehydration after the first 4 hours of treatment, then patients can be sent home with the same instructions described above under treatment Plan A.  If the patient vomits while taking fluid, wait 10 minutes. Then allow the patient to resume feeding, but more slowly. Continue monitoring the patient and replacing fluid until the diarrhoea stops. When the patient is ready to leave the facility, counsel the patient on treating diarrhoea at home. Refer to IMCI guidelines for treating children under-5 years of age and to national guidelines for further information on treating acute watery diarrhoea and confirmed cholera. . Plan A. Oral rehydration for patients with no signs of dehydration Patients with no signs of dehydration should be treated with oral rehydration solution (ORS).  There is no need to admit the patients with no signs of dehydration to the CTU/CTC. They can be treated with ORS at home, at ORPs or at the outpatient area at the health facility.  If patient is seen at the health facility:  Keep the patient for observation for 2-4 hours to ensure they are tolerating ORS. During observation and before sending home, provide clear instructions for care. Advise patients or caregivers to continue giving ORS after each loose stool and to come back immediately if condition deteriorates (repeated vomiting, number of stools increased or if the patient is drinking or eating poorly). ORS must be prepared with safe water (boiled or treated with a chlorine product or household bleach). It should not be stored for more than 24 hours (make fresh daily). ORS should be given regularly, in small amounts. If a patient vomits ORS, slow the administration of ORS and then slowly increase again when vomiting stops. Patients should receive ORS after each loose stool to maintain hydration until diarrhoea stops Patients should receive the following amounts of ORS following each loose stool: Age\\ufdd0Quantity of ORS\\ufdd0< 2 years\\ufdd050-100 ml\\ufdd02-9 years\\ufdd0100-200 ml\\ufdd0≥10 years\\ufdd0as much as wanted Discharge Consider to discharge if patient: Has no signs of dehydration Is able to take ORS without vomiting. Has no watery stools for 4 hours Is able to walk without assistance. Is passing urine. Has been advised when to return to hospital/CTC. Prior to discharge, provide patients and their caretakers with ORS and instructions on how to prepare it. Inform patient, family members and caretakers about precautions and instructions at household level:  For children, continue breast-feeding of infants and young children  Drink and use safe water. Wash hands at critical times including after using a toilet (including helping a child) and before preparing and eating food. If caring for a patient, always wash hands after proving care and after handing any soiled items such as clothes or linens. Cook food thoroughly and eat it while it is still hot.  Remove and wash any bedding or clothing that may have had contact with diarrhoeal stool with the appropriate chlorine solution (0.02%). If chlorine is not available, patients’ bedding and clothing can be disinfected by stirring them for 5 minutes in boiling water and drying in direct sunlight, or by washing with soap and drying it thoroughly in direct sunlight. Use a flush toilet or approved septic system; double bag soiled materials when discarding in trash. Use any household disinfectant or a 1:10 dilution of bleach solution (1part bleach to 9 parts water) to clean any area that may have contact with faecal matter, as soon as possible after being soiled. If a household member develops acute, watery diarrhoea, administer oral rehydration solution (ORS) and seek healthcare immediately While caring for persons who are ill with cholera, do not serve food or drink to persons who are not household members Visitors can be allowed if the ill person wants company; visitors should also observe hand hygiene recommendation Give patients information about home care before they leave the health facility on danger signs and when to return to the facility again; return for treatment if the patient develops any of the following: increased number of watery stools eating or drinking poorly marked thirst repeated vomiting fever blood in the stool 2.

Annex 6C: Planning an emergency immunization activity Review with health workers the need to plan vaccination campaigns and specify the target population for the immunization activity Estimate the necessary amounts of vaccine, diluent, and immunization supplies such as sterile syringes and sterile needles, cold boxes, vaccine carriers and safety boxes Coordinate with national Immunization and Disease Prevention Control (IVD) program, WHO country office and UNICEF offices to arrange for provision of necessary vaccine and supplies  A list of pre-qualified WHO vaccines is available at: http://www.who.int/immunization_standards/vaccine_quality/PQ_vaccine_list_en/en/. If a country has already an ICC, ensure the discussion also discussion is done and agreed on the type of vaccine to be give, who to give and the methodology to be used Contact the national level to request vaccine. If a national reserve stock is not available, the national IVD program manager will request an emergency supply from WHO. Choose the immunization sites and inform the community. Coordinate with the EPI/IVD or disease control program in your district to identify sites for conducting the immunization activity. Identify the facilities that can participate in the activity Identify a mobile immunization team, if needed. Determine if there are any hard-to-reach areas, e.g. a transient workers’ camp. Identify a mobile immunization team to reach these areas. Contact the facilities and schedule the immunization sites. Make sure there is enough capacity to store extra amounts of the vaccine during storage and transportation to the immunization site. Conduct a comprehensive microplanning for the campaign. A microplan is the operational plan   for a campaign at the county or lower level. Ensure the plan has at least the following:  Estimate of the number of vaccination teams required and their composition including roles and responsibility of team members, as well as number of supervisors and monitors  List of supervisors and their contact numbers  Travel plan for teams and supervisors including transportation requirements  Map the coordination with other partners and regions/districts local partners like NGOs, faith-based and civic organizations etc. Maps of the targeted area  Cold chain requirements and maintenance  Plan for distribution of logistics  Plans for disposal of waste from campaign  Social mobilization plan with community leaders mapped and engaged  Training schedule  Budgetary estimates for the various campaign components including training and planning prior to implementation and waste disposal following implementation  \\t5.\\tSelect immunization teams. For every 100 to 150 people expected at the immunization site,         the followed staff is required: One to two vaccinators to give immunizations One recorder to record on immunization cards Community health workers if already exist or an identified community volunteer to verify age        and immunization status. \\t6.\\tWork with your EPI/IVD team to conduct refresher training for vaccinators on recommended            immunization practices. Ensure instructions are given for the use of safe injection techniques.  7.\\tMobilize the community. Inform the public about the emergency immunization Activity while ensuring that; There is a clear communication plan that includes easy to understand information about:  the need for the campaign;  There is a clearly defined target group who is to be targeted for the campaign;  There is a clear understanding of the dates of the campaign  The communication plan has mechanisms for rapidly identifying and addressing rumours that        may arise during the campaign  There is a single point of contact well versed in risk communications and the local culture  There is a clear plan for monitoring any adverse effects 8.\\tArrange staff transportation to the immunization site. Plan their transportation to and from the site Schedule vehicles and plan for fuel and other costs Estimate per diem costs and make necessary arrangements for lodging if the site is away from the health worker’s usual station. 9.\\tMonitor the overall campaign process and the number of doses of vaccine given. Collect daily summary sheets from teams  Calculate the amount of remaining stocks and supplies necessary for the next day  Estimated number of individuals vaccinated should be followed daily and tracked against target population  Follow up visit plans should be made for missed individuals based on tally/summary sheet information  Document any missing houses/individuals who should be follow up on subsequent days Review the team available at sight and if necessary re allocate/deploy the teams to other sites basing on the workload Conduct brief feedback sessions at the end of each day with vaccination teams and make necessary mid-course corrections  Give instructions for use of safe injection techniques. Review with health workers the need to plan vaccination campaigns  NB: A rapid guide to common SIA problems and potential quick fixes is available at:  http://www.polioeradication.org/Portals/0/Document/Resources/PolioEradicators/ 1c.QuickFixesforSIA20100914.pdf  Annex 6D: Estimating vaccine supplies for immunization activities Outbreak: \\tDate confirmed: Target population:\\t___ children age 0 up to 5 years children age 9 months up to 14 years children and adults age 0 up to 30 years women of childbearing age - 15 years up to 45 years all adults and children in the general population Calculate the size of the target population.

Estimate the number of safety boxes required Annex 6E: Recommended immunization practices Work with your EPI team to give refresher training to the vaccinator teams that will conduct the emergency immunization activity. As a minimum, make sure vaccinator teams know how to: Reconstitute the vaccine correctly: --\\tDetermine the appropriate quantity of diluent to reconstitute the freeze-dried vaccine. --\\tUse a sterile syringe and sterile needle for each dose. --\\tUsing the dilution syringe, draw up and expel the diluent several times in the vial that contains the vaccine so as to mix the reconstituted vaccine well. Wrap the vial in silver foil or cover it with a dark cloth. This will protect the vial from sunlight. In a field situation, protect the vaccine and diluent from contamination. Cover the open top of the vial with foil to keep out dirt and flies. Place reconstituted vaccine vials and opened liquid vaccine vials immediately stand them on shilled ice, or stand them on an ice pack. Keep the ice and vaccines in the shade. Follow multi dose vial policy as applicable e.g. for measles and polio,  Record the dose on an immunization card for each person immunized, if it is national policy to require immunized persons to have a card. Collect data for monitoring the activity. For example, record the number of doses given on a tally sheet so that coverage from the campaign can be calculated. Remind health workers about the risk of getting blood-borne diseases from an accidental needle stick. Review safe practices for handling and disposing of sharp instruments and needles using a sharps box. Arrange for safe disposal of used injection materials at the end of the activity. They can be burned or buried in a pit according to medical waste disposal guidelines. Annex 6F: Sample messages for community education Improve hand washing Hand-washing with soap may be the most effective way to prevent transmission of some organisms causing infectious diseases. For that reason, promote hand-washing in every family. Hand-washing is particularly important after defecation, after cleaning a child who has defecated, after disposing of a child’s stool, before preparing or handling food and before eating. Hand-washing is practiced more frequently where water is plentiful and within easy reach. If possible, water for washing should be stored separately from drinking-water. During an epidemic, soap should be provided to those without it. If soap is not available, wood ash or alcohol hand rub can be used to scrub the hands. Do not dry washed hands with dirty cloths. Air-dry wet hands. Message: ARE YOU PROTECTED FROM DYSENTERY (bloody diarrhoea)?  Washing your hands protects yourself and others from disease. Always wash your hands: after defecation after cleaning a child who has defecated after disposing of a child’s stool before and after eating before preparing or handling food. ARE YOU READY FOR HAND-WASHING? \\u2029Do you have\\u2029Clean water and soap (or if you do not have soap, use ash or earth to scrub your hands)\\u2029Clean cloth for drying. Message: Safe Handling of food Encourage the following food safety practices: Wash hands with soap before preparing food Thoroughly wash the fruit and green vegetables before consuming using clean water Cook food until it is hot throughout Eat food while it is still hot, or reheat it thoroughly before eating Wash all cooking and serving utensils after use Keep cooked food and clean utensils separate from uncooked foods and potentially contaminated utensils Cover your food appropriately. Message: DO YOU PREPARE FOOD SAFELY? Cooking kills germs Thoroughly cook all meats, fish and vegetables Eat cooked meats, fish and vegetables while they are hot. Washing protects from disease Wash your hands before preparing or serving food Wash your dishes and utensils with soap and water Wash your cutting board especially well with soap. Peeling protects from disease Only eat fruits that have been freshly peeled (such as bananas and oranges) KEEP IT CLEAN: COOK IT, PEEL IT, OR LEAVE IT. Five Keys to Safer Food Keep clean Separate raw and cooked Cook thoroughly Keep food at safe temperature Use safe water and raw materials ￼ Safe disposal of Human Waste High priority should be given to ensuring the safe disposal of human waste at all time, and especially during epidemics of diarrhoea. Sanitary systems appropriate for local conditions should be constructed with the cooperation of the community. Community messages should emphasize: Everyone should use latrines properly, including children Transfer children’s excreta with a scoop or shovel to the latrine or bury in a hole. Avoid defecating on the ground, or in or near the water supply. When large groups of people congregate - as for fairs, funerals, or religious festivals, ensure the safe disposal of human waste. If there is no latrine, designate areas for defecation and provide a shovel to bury the excreta. Message: ARE YOU PROTECTED FROM DYSENTERY (bloody diarrhoea)? DO YOU USE A TOILET OR LATRINE? Germs that cause dysentery live in faeces. Even a person who is healthy might have dysentery germs. Always use a toilet or latrine. It you don’t have one – build one! Keep the toilet or latrine clean Wash your hands with soap (or ash) and clean water after using the toilet or latrine. KEEP IT CLEAN: USE A TOILET OR LATRINE Clean drinking water and storage Community drinking water supply and storage Piped water. To maintain safety, properly chlorinate piped water. To prevent entry of contaminated groundwater into pipes, repair leaking joints and maintain constant pressure in the system. Closed wells. Equip with a well-head drainage apron, and with a pulley, windlass, or pump. Trucked in. If locally available water is likely to be contaminated, drinking water should be supplied by tankers or transported in drums, if it is adequately chlorinated and a regular supply can be ensured. The trucking of water, however, is expensive and difficult to sustain; it is usually considered a short-term measure until a local supply can be established. Home drinking water storage and treatment When the safety of the drinking water is uncertain, it should be chlorinated in the home or boiled. To prevent contamination of drinking water, families should store drinking water using one of the following types of containers: Covered containers that are cleaned daily and kept away from children and animals. Water should be removed from the containers using a long-handled dipper, kept especially for this purpose. Narrow-mouthed containers with an opening too small to allow the insertion of a hand. Water should be removed by pouring from the opening or spout. Water used for bathing, washing and other purposes other than drinking need not be treated and should be stored separately from drinking water. Safe disposal of bodies The body fluids of persons who die due to diarrhoea or a viral haemorrhagic fever are still infectious. Use extreme caution when preparing the bodies of suspected cholera or viral haemorrhagic fever patients. Encourage safe funeral and burial practices Reducing Exposure to mosquitoes Mosquito control is the main intervention for reducing malaria transmission. It can reduce malaria transmission from very high levels to close to zero. In high transmission areas, mosquito control can significantly reduce child and maternal deaths. Personal protection against mosquito bites represents the first line of defence for malaria prevention. Message: ARE YOU PROTECTED FROM MOSQUITOBITES?  Whenever possible, Avoid going out between dusk and dawn when mosquitoes commonly bite. Wear long-sleeved clothing and long trousers when going out at night, and avoid dark colours, which attract mosquitoes. Apply insect repellent to exposed skin ( if the repellent is available) Use screens over doors and windows. Use a insecticide treated mosquito net over the bed Use anti-mosquito sprays or insecticide dispenser (if available)  Malaria transmission can rapidly be reduced by indoor residual spraying (IRS) with insecticides. IRS works for between 3 to12 months, depending on the insecticide used and the type of surface on which it is sprayed. Annex 6G: Outbreak communication Introduction Following confirmation and verification of the event, the primary health and the district level authorities should liaise with the national level authorities to communicate and receive guidance on common positions to be delivered to the media. From first announcement throughout the outbreak, communication from the district level should follow the directions and the key messages developed at national level in consultation with the field team, in order to ensure consistency and speaking with one voice. Even though communication should be centrally coordinated by the national level, media would approach local and district public health response level to obtain first-hand information from direct sources. In addition, the director of the district level hospital should support the communication and provide scientific expertise as evidence for intervention. Actions at the district level Identify spokesperson(s) at district level (political and technical); Liaise regularly with national authorities to provide them with first-hand information (received at the community local level, the media, local stakeholders); Be in contact regularly with national authorities to receive common messages including guide and answers for frequently asked questions to feed the local media; Be available for interviews by local media upon request to provide accurate, transparent and updated information following directions from national level in simple clear key messages; Organize press briefings to provide regular information to local media, following directions from national level; Develop good relationships with local media to partnership for delivery of accurate, transparent, timely messages to the population; Use information materials developed at the national level with clear consistent messages to provide guidance to the population; Identify local powerful channels for the delivery of information to the population; Meet regularly with local stakeholders to disseminate correct message of prevention and surveillance to the population; Organize preventive door-to-door campaigns to reach the remote rural areas and promote prevention and surveillance, following directions from national level. Annex 6H: Guide to infection prevention and control measures  Hand Washing Purpose: ￼To protect the patient, staff and care givers from cross infection Responsibility:  Clinicians, Environmental health practitioner, care giver  Steps in hand washing:  ￼ The hands are washed thoroughly for a minimum of 10-15 seconds with soap (plain or antimicrobial) and running water (tap or run to waste method) Remove jewelleries (rings, bracelets) and watches before washing hands, ensure that the nails are clipped short (do not wear artificial nails), Roll the sleeves up to the elbow. Wet the hands and wrists, keeping hands and wrists lower than the elbows (permit the water to flow to the fingertips, avoiding arm contamination). Apply soap (plain or antimicrobial or ash) and lather thoroughly. Use firm, circular motions to wash the hands and arms up to the wrists, covering all areas including palms, back of the hands, fingers, between fingers and lateral side of the fifth finger, knuckles, and wrists. Rub for minimum of 10-15 seconds. Repeat the process if the hands are very soiled. Clean under the fingernails. Rinse hands thoroughly, keeping the hands lower than the forearms. If running water is not available, use a bucket and pitcher. Do not dip your hands into a bowl to rinse, as this re-contaminates them. Collect used water in a basin and discard in a sink, drain or toilet. Dry hands thoroughly with disposable paper towel or napkins, clean dry towel, or air dry them. Discard the towel if used, in an appropriate container without touching the bin lids with hand. Use a paper towel, clean towel or your elbow/foot to turn off the faucet to prevent re-contamination. ￼ Different types of antiseptic disinfection: Using antiseptics, hand rubs gels or alcohol swabs for hand antisepsis Apply the product to the palm of one hand. The volume needed to apply varies by product.  Rub hands together, covering all surfaces of hands and fingers, until hands are dry  Do not rinse.  Note: When there is visible soiling of hands, they should first be washed with soap and water before using waterless hand rubs gels or alcohol swabs  In situations where soap is not available, ash can be used for washing hands  Hand Hygiene Techniques ￼This is a process, which mechanically removes soil and debris from skin and reduces the number of transient microorganisms. Hand washing with plain soap and clean water is as effective in cleaning hands and removing transient microorganisms as washing with antimicrobial soaps and causes less skin irritation. Steps: Thoroughly wet hands.  Apply a hand-washing agent (liquid soap); an antiseptic agent is not necessary.  Vigorously rub all areas of hands and fingers for 10–15 seconds (tip: 10 average breaths), paying close attention to fingernails and between fingers.  Rinse hands thoroughly with clean running water from a tap or bucket.  Dry hands with paper towel or a clean, dry towel or air-dry them.  Use a paper towel or clean, dry towel when turning off water if there is no foot control or automatic shut off.                                                                                                                                                                 Source: World Health Organization (WHO) 2005. NB: If bar soap is used, provide small bars and soap racks that drain.  Use running water and avoid dipping hands into a basin containing standing water; even with the addition of an antiseptic agent, microorganisms can survive and multiply in these solutions.  Do not add soap to a partially empty liquid soap dispenser. This practice of “topping off” dispensers may lead to bacterial contamination of the soap.  When soap dispensers are reused, they should be thoroughly cleaned before filling.  When no running water is available, use a bucket with a tap that can be turned off to lather hands and turned on again for rinsing, or use a bucket and pitcher.  Used water should be collected in a basin and discarded in a latrine if a drain is not available.  ￼Guidance to donning and doffing of PPE Steps to put on WHO PPE using coverall  Remove all personal items (jewellery, watches, cell phones, pens, etc.) Put on the scrub suit and rubber boots* in the changing room. Move to the clean area at the entrance of the isolation unit Gather PPE beforehand. Select the right size coverall. Putting on PPE under the guidance and supervision of a buddy Perform hand hygiene. Put on inner gloves (examination, nitrile). Put on coverall. Thumb (or middle finger) hole in the coverall sleeve or thumb loop.  Put on face mask. Put on face protection (either face shield or goggles) Put on head covering: Surgical bonnet or hood. Put on disposable waterproof apron.  Put on outer gloves (examination, nitrile) over cuff. Self-check in mirror. Check buddy and write name/ occupation/ time of entry. ￼Steps to take off WHO PPE using coverall Always remove PPE under the guidance and supervision of a trained observer (colleague). Enter decontamination area by walking through chlorine tray.  Perform hand hygiene on gloved hands (0.5% chlorine). Remove apron taking care to avoid contaminating your hands by peeling it off. Perform hand hygiene on gloved hands (0.5% chlorine). Remove hood or bonnet taking care to avoid contaminating your face. Perform hand hygiene on gloved hands (0.5% chlorine). Remove coverall and outer pair of gloves. Tilt head back to reach zipper, unzip completely without touching any skin or scrubs, remove coverall from top to bottom.  After freeing shoulders, remove the outer gloves while pulling the arms out of the sleeves.  With inner gloves roll the coverall, from the waist down and from the inside of the coverall, down to the top of the boots. Use one boot to pull off coverall from other boot and vice versa, and then step away from the coverall and dispose of it safely. Perform hand hygiene on gloved hands (0.5% chlorine) Remove the goggles or face shield from behind the head (keep eyes closed). Perform hand hygiene on gloved hands (0.5% chlorine) Remove mask from behind the head (keep eyes closed). Perform hand hygiene on gloved hands (0.5% chlorine). Remove inner gloves with appropriate technique and dispose of safely. Decontaminate boots appropriately and move to lower risk area one foot at a time and Perform hand hygiene (0.05% chlorine). Setting up a cholera isolation campy/unit/cholera Treatment Centre (CTC)  a. Site management There are different recommendations for different situations/circumstances: In urban settings and refugee camps: Establish CTC + several Oral Rehydration Points (ORPs) Ideally, the CTC should be located inside the existing hospital premises but clearly separated and isolated from the other departments to avoid spread of infection to non-cholera patients. If the hospital premises are not suitable, another site must be found. In urban/camp settings, It is preferable to have one single CTC and several ORPs rather than setting up multiple CTCs, thereby increasing potential sources of infection. When affected areas are too far from the CTC, access can become a problem. Ambulances can be provided for referral, or a CTU may be established as an intermediate structure. Use of taxis/buses should be discouraged given the high contamination risk during the journey. In rural settings:  Establish Cholera Treatment Units (CTU)  The CTU should be located inside the health facility, or close to it. If this is not possible, other existing structures may be used. CTUs may paralyses routine health services as adequate case management is labour-intensive and other health services may suffer from staff shortage. In areas that are far from any treatment facility, it may be possible to decentralize the CTU to the level of the affected villages. Oral rehydration Points (ORPs) ORS points have two objectives: to treat patients, and to screen off and refer severely dehydrated patients to CTC/CTU(s). They reduce pressure on overburdened CTCs or CTUs. They can be decentralized to the community level. The community health worker should receive quick training and regular supplies, to be able to achieve given objectives. Design of a CTC Selection criteria When establishing a cholera treatment centres, the following should be considered when selecting a site: Proximity to the affected area.  Easy accessibility for patients and supplies.  Protected from winds (there should be wind breaks)  Adequate space.  Compatibility with adjacent existing structures and activities  Availability of adequate potable/safe water supply within a minimum distance to avoid contamination.  Good drainage from the site  Provision of waste management facilities (clinical and general waste)  Availability of sanitary facilities (temporary)  Provision for extension of CTC (basing on estimation given by epidemiologist)  Setting up a temporary cholera treatment camp  In setting up a cholera camp, you can use an existing building or set up tents.  It is important to consider safety of patients and ventilation as high temperatures contributes to dehydration of the patients.  The cholera camp should operate 24 hours a day independently of the other health facilities and therefore the necessary staff has to be recruited.  It should be supplied with the necessary medical material specifically for the centre.  An enclosure or other form of acceptable screen should be provided around the cholera camp.  The various workstations should be clearly labelled and directions provided.  The CTC must be a “closed system” where contamination is introduced through patients, and must be destroyed inside the structure. Under no circumstances should any contamination come out (through patients, water, material, solid and liquid waste etc.).  General rules for a good design:  Strict necessary movement for staff and patient  Each zone is a “closed box”  Systematic disinfection between zones  Discipline and mutual control for the patient, attendant and staff on hygiene  Good infection control means anything coming out is free of contamination ￼The diagram below is a layout of cholera treatment centre. Triage and observation  Patients are examined by a medical person for screening. If cholera, admit; otherwise send to normal dispensary.  Patients are admitted with 1 attendant (caregiver) if necessary.  Patients who are admitted are registered in the cholera line list.  A foot bath should be provided at the entrance  Toilets and water should be easily accessible for patients.  Shower facilities should be provided for the patients.  A disinfection area should be provided for the transporting vehicles and contaminated articles for the patients.  Tables, chairs, water containers fitted with taps, refuse receptacles should be provided in these areas.  Provision of safe water  Establish an ORP corner  Admissions area  Patients with severe dehydration and/or uncontrollable vomiting must be    hospitalized for immediate rehydration.  Each patient lies on a Cholera bed with 1 bucket for stool collection underneath the hole in the bed and 1 bucket for vomit besides the bed. The following should be put in place or provided in the admissions area;  Separate rooms/tents for males and females where possible.  Separate rooms for children, the old and pregnant women as risk of abortion increases with cholera  A foot bath and hand washing facilities (with disinfectant) at the entrance  Provision for disinfection of soiled linen and clothing.  Patients should have access to toilets and washing facilities (with disinfectant) or showers (should be provided where possible).  Cholera beds with receiving buckets, buckets for those who vomit and water containers for patients.  Tables and chairs for staff  Refuse receptacles  Patients should be screened by medical staff and categorized according to their status.  A Convalescence/recovery area The convalescence or recovery area is meant for oral rehydration after hospitalization when less surveillance is required. Patients can stay on mats or benches, as in the observation area.  The patients who are no longer vomiting nor have diarrhoea and requiring less medical attention can be put in this ward.  Separate rooms/tents should be provided for males and female.  Annex 6I: Response to chemical and radio-nuclear events Response to Radiological events If an accident is suspected: Prevent inadvertent ingestion of contamination (e.g. wear gloves, do not smoke or eat) Perform life saving measures and provide first aid for serious injuries immediately, before conducting radiological monitoring Keep people away from any potential source of exposure (at least 10 m from the public) Arrange to transport seriously injured people to local medical facility. Wrap them in a blanket to control the spread of contamination. Tell those transporting victims and the receiving medical facility that the person may be contaminated and that the risk to those treating such a patient is negligible but care should be taken to prevent Inadvertent ingestion of contamination. Identify and register potentially exposed/contaminated individuals. Gather information that could be useful in reconstructing their dose to include medical symptoms and description of events. Report to appropriate officials and obtain instructions If not seriously injured, remain in the area until monitored. Respond to action threshold: If an accident is confirmed: Reassess and review with relevant departments and agencies medium to long term protective actions such as food chain restrictions. Provide the population with useful, timely truthful, consistent and appropriate information as to the likely health effects of the emergency by reference to existing knowledge. Arrange for detailed clinical and radiological review of affected persons. Promptly provide the public with the results of any medical examinations. Establish and maintain an appropriate disease surveillance programme. Establish a registry of persons to be tracked and to receive long-term follow-up. Base inclusion in the registry on objective criteria that indicate potential for an increase in the incidence of radiation induced cancer. Begin surveillance of any identified groups at risk, e.g. screening for thyroid disease in children in an area affected by radioactive iodine release. Assist Government authorities in planning a return to normal life for the population affected. External contamination Use instrumental contamination monitoring.  Use cotton swabs for skin, nostrils, ear canals, wounds or any contaminated object.  Each swab should be placed in a labelled test tube for counting. Internal contamination Use instrumental detection methods such as whole body counting, gamma camera, thyroid counting.  Radionuclides may be in the blood or excreted in the faeces or urine. Excreta should be placed in appropriate containers and blood samples in test tubes for counting. Decontamination Procedures Materials: Lukewarm water, soap or ordinary detergent, soft brush, sponges, plastic sheets, tape, towels, sheets, iodine tablets or solution. Procedural priority: Remove all clothing and place in plastic bags. Carry out life saving measures first. Identify contaminated areas, mark clearly and cover until decontamination takes place. Start with decontamination of wounds when present, and move on to the most contaminated area of the body. Local contamination:  Cover uncontaminated area with plastic sheet and tape edges. Soak the contaminated area, gently scrub with soap, and rinse thoroughly. Repeat the cycle and observe changes in activity. One cycle should not last longer than about 2–3 min. Avoid vigorous scrubbing. A stable isotope solution may facilitate the process. For wounds, irrigate with normal saline solution repeatedly. Surgical debridement might be considered in some instances. Eyes and ears may be irrigated gently with isotonic saline solution. Extensive contamination:  Shower those not seriously injured. Bathing may be done on the operating table or stretcher for the seriously injured.  Soak– scrub–rinse cycle should also be observed. Inhalation: Irrigate nasopharynx and mouth. Ingestion: Administer cathartics for insoluble materials. Administer diuretics by forcing fluids for soluble contaminants. Prophylactic measures Cover areas still contaminated with plastic sheet and tape edges. Gloves can be used for hands. Repeat washing after allowing the skin to rest. Treatment Erythema and dry desquamation can be treated symptomatically. Lotions or sprays containing hydrocortisone can be used to relieve the symptoms associated with severe erythema accompanied by oedema. To treat moist desquamation, daily dressings and bathing of the affected skin in antiseptic solutions is helpful. Antibiotic creams can also be used. For ulceration, isolation of the limb in a sterile environment or daily dressing and bathing of the ulcer in antiseptic solutions is recommended. Analgesics or stronger opioids may be necessary. In the event of suspected or verified secondary infection, topical or systemic antibiotic therapy should be considered. For necrosis, only surgical treatment is effective. Surgical toilet is indicated. Excision of deep necrosis followed by skin grafts or other kinds of grafting may be conducted when indicated. Indications for amputation include very severe lesions with destruction of underlying tissues, including vascular damage, intractable pain and lack of infection control. Expected outcome Radionuclide activity is no longer detectable or is decreasing. Response to Chemical Event/Attack Components of rescue and medical services: Search and rescue teams Emergency medical teams used for day-to-day emergencies (Medical officers, nurses, first aiders, ambulance) Field medical services (field medical teams and posts) Medical emergency response plans and procedures Personnel and equipment to reinforce the resources available for day-to-day emergencies A transport service for medical evacuations Hospitals with casualty and surgical units At the emergency site: Operate as close as possible (but within safe distance) to the emergency site. Collaborate closely with different rescue teams (engineering, fire fighters, decontamination and human rescue groups). Ensure all rescue workers don appropriate PPEs. Assess the situation to determine that there is no eminent danger Rescue teams should locate casualties and remove them from danger. Rescue team should do primary medical assessment to identify and manage life threatening conditions. Assess: Airway Breathing Circulation Rescue team should provide First Aid and record details of first aid provided before forwarding casualties to field medical teams. Field medical services post/s: Establish field medical post/s. Field medical teams perform primary/secondary medical assessment. Assign triage category to casualties based on the medical assessment. Initiate appropriate treatment. Prepare casualties for evacuation to hospital according to triage category. Continue documentation of casualties. Provide surveillance of casualties awaiting evacuation. Liaise with casualty transport service. Evacuate casualties to appropriate medical facilities according to priorities. Ensure continuity of medical care for casualties along the whole length of the chain from the emergency site to the hospital. Provide information to receiving medical facilities as necessary. Treat minor injuries not requiring hospitalization. Hospital services: Prepare for casualty reception. Do a medical assessment to identify and manage life-threatening conditions. Assign triage category based on assessments. Provide appropriate treatment according to triage priorities and available hospital resources. Continue medical documentation of casualties. Undertake surgical procedures where necessary. Provide post-operative care and release casualties.

Risk communication is real time two-way exchange of information, perceptions and advice among risk assessors, risk managers, and various groups of people in the society about the likelihood and consequences of harm from the event (WHO, 2005). Its ultimate purpose is that everyone at risk is able to take informed decisions to mitigate the effects of the threat (hazard) such as a disease outbreak and take protective and preventive action.  Risk communication uses a mix of communication and engagement strategies and tactics, including but not limited to, mass media communications, social media, mass awareness campaigns, health promotion, stakeholder engagement, social mobilization and community engagement.  The current 21st century, has witnessed an exponential growth in travel, trade and migration, coupled with also communication technology revolution providing massive access to a variety of means of communication and information. The public and communities have been part of and exposed to a variety of dynamic, fast-changing, formal and informal media, social media and complex social networks that influence how risk is communicated, perceived and acted on. The latest evidence shows that the practice of risk communication is a complex task that is a core public health intervention in any response to disease outbreaks/epidemics, pandemics and other health emergencies (Communicating Risk in Public Health Emergencies: Geneva. World Health Organization 2017, License CC BY-NC-SA 3’ IGO).  It is therefore important for risk communication to be conducted in order to promote the primary public health goal of rapid outbreak containment, preventing avoidable death and disease with the least possible disruption to economies and society. During epidemics and pandemics, humanitarian crises and natural disasters, effective risk communication allows people most at risk to understand and adopt protective behaviours. It allows authorities and experts to listen to and address people’s concerns and needs so that the advice they provide is relevant, trusted and acceptable. This section describes how to conduct risk communication before, during and after an outbreak. Effective communication provides those at risk with the knowledge to make informed decisions for protective action when linked to functioning service. It also provides decision makers with summary information especially if there was an outbreak response, allowing them to review how resources were applied to contain the event. 7.1 Risk Communication in the context of IDSR IDSR strategy is an approach for improving public health surveillance and response for priority diseases, conditions and events at community, health facility, district and national levels. Since IDSR is a system with the potential to ensure a reliable supply of information to the national level in order to fulfil IHR requirements, risk communication should be integrated in all the IDSR core functions and activities particularly detection, sample collection, reporting, analysis and interpretation, feedback, response and preparedness. The IDSR core functions and activities for each level of the health system are well illustrated in the Introduction section of this guideline. Effective risk communication is therefore needed to achieve the objectives for IDSR  If well planned and integrated in IDSR, risk communication can improve decision making and adoption of recommended behaviours by communities and contribute to the prevention, control and response to priority diseases and other public health events. Such communication needs to be carefully planned and implemented as well as properly integrated with emergency management activities and operations at community, district, and national levels to support all the relevant core IDSR functions and related activities at that level.  7.1.1 Benefits of Risk Communication Risk communication improves decision making compliance with treatment and required behaviours for preventive actions, promotes transparency and accountability and builds trust with individuals, community leaders, health workers and policy makers. When risk communication is effectively carried out, it promotes the primary public health goal of rapid outbreak containment preventing avoidable death and disease and with the least possible disruption to economies and society. During epidemics and pandemics, and humanitarian crises and natural disasters, effective risk communication allows people most at risk to understand and adopt protective behaviours. It allows authorities and experts to listen to and address people’s concerns and needs so that the advice they provide is relevant, trusted and acceptable. It is critical that risk communication is not only targeted at outbreak response, risk communication plans should include activities before, during and after the outbreak When the public is at risk of a real or potential health threat, direct interventions may take time to organize and resources may be few. Communicating advice and guidance, therefore, often stands as the first and most important public health tool in managing a risk. Pro-active risk communication encourages the public and service providers to adopt protective behaviours when they are linked to functioning systems and services. It facilitates heightened disease surveillance, reduces confusion, and minimizes miscommunication and falsehoods (rumours) in relation to the cause, transmission of a disease and proven effective protective actions. It allows for a better use of resources, all of which are necessary for an effective response (WHO, 2008). 7.1.2 Target audiences for risk communication Community: All people at risk of acquiring disease or in need of health services within the context of the public health event. Health-care providers and first responders Private hospitals and clinic staff Surveillance Officers Laboratory staff Point of Entry and Exit staff Airlines staff Immigration officers Travellers Stakeholders (policy-makers, ministries of health, maternal and child health organizations, partners, community organizations, et al.)  Media as a channel to reach these audiences Schools and workplaces Traditional, political and Religious leaders 7.1.3 Community engagement in Public Health Emergencies preparedness and response Community engagement, or public participation, is defined by the International Association for Public Participation (IAP2) as: “any process that involves the public in problem solving or decision making and uses     public input to make better decisions.” Community engagement will allow community members through community structures and community leadership to actively contribute to key decisions and actions in the delivery of interventions or programs including public health emergencies preparedness and response.   Community engagement is the process of working collaboratively with and through people affiliated by geographic proximity, special interest, or similar situations to address issues affecting the wellbeing and is used as an active method of implementing change.  Community engagement is very crucial element when introducing interventions in the community to increase uptake and address hesitancy that threaten the success of the program. When introducing the emergencies preparedness and response program or intervention, communities should be properly engaged to ensure successful implementation.  7.1.3.1 Importance of Community Engagement in public health emergency preparedness and response Effective, proactive, and responsive community engagement has various benefits and will enable government and other stakeholders to: build relationships within community structures and between stakeholders; build management and leadership capacity and capability; improve community participation across the various districts;  increase community confidence with the government;  enable communities to make informed decisions and take action in the delivery of the program in the country.  7.1.3.2 Why engaging communities? By getting involved in a decision process of the emergency’s preparedness and response, you can:  voice your concerns or experiences   learn about the matters government and partners must consider before making decisions; share your ideas and needs  find out more information about the project or plan directly from the project team  hear what the communities think; be a leading voice for your community on the program; 7.1.3.3 Key stakeholders in COVID-19 response and Vaccine program All stakeholders should be involved at onset throughout the planning, implementation, and evaluation phases. Communities should be empowered to assist in making decisions and to implement and manage the preparedness and response. The stakeholders to be engaged include the Traditional leaders, Civil Society, faith based leaders, youth and women church associations, Faith Based Organisations, Community Based Organisations, Non-governmental Organisations, Political leaders, Community structures such as ADCs, VDCs, CHAGS, VHCS, HCMCS, HMCs, mother care group, vulnerable groups and the community members themselves. The engagement with these stakeholders should be on a continuous basis for better outcomes.  7.1.3.4 What should communities be engaged on? Communities should be brief about the risks and all information required by the emergency preparedness and response.  Provide simplified information on the emergency  Hear them out on their concerns  Clarify on the myths and misconceptions, misinformation e.t.c and provide Reassurance  Ask for their suggestions Consensus on their decisions, involvement and clarify their roles 7.1.3.4 Platforms to be utilized for engagement  There are several platforms that can be utilised to engage communities. These include; Religious gatherings and church functions Village meetings Political rallies  Community Dialogue meetings Funerals Social gatherings such weddings, engagement ceremonies  7.1.3.5 Steps of Community Engagement  Community engagement has several steps to ensure that communities, public and stakeholders are fully engaged in community health programs and interventions. These steps are stipulated in Figure 2 below. ￼ Figure 1: Steps of Community Engagement in a Program 7.1.3.6   Roles and Responsibilities of Key Stakeholders in emergency preparedness and response All stakeholders need to be engaged to raise awareness on their roles on Community emergency preparedness and response Program in the country. The stakeholders have vital roles on community engagement to support in the delivery of community health in the country and in turn engage with their communities on uptake of these services.  Roles of Chiefs, Village Headmen, Block Leaders, Cultural Custodians: Work with everyone in the community; Conduct community awareness based on emergency preparedness and response messages shared by the Ministry of Health (MoH); Ensure compliance with government guidance on emergencies response Monitor outbreaks that those affected within the community  Bring together multiple actors and/or stakeholders to share emergency preparedness and   response information and avoid duplication or possible message conflicts; Support CHWs in rumour management and discourage stigma and discrimination; Establish/set by-laws to prohibit negative cultural practices  Roles of Faith leaders including women and youth groups Support preparedness and response planning to operationalize response plans at community level; Raising awareness and risk communication on the emergencies and response in church gatherings or platforms; Disseminating technical guidance as per MoH guidelines at all times; Aligning with national emergency preparedness response taskforce and multi-sector coordination platforms; Support community mobilization on adherence to the emergencies and response messaging; Continue reinforcement adherence to the emergencies and response interventions at all church gatherings or platforms. Roles of CSOs, NGOs, CBOs, FBOs: Raising awareness and risk communication on the emergencies and response; Disseminating technical guidance as per MoH guidelines; Partner mapping, training and coordination to minimize duplication of efforts in emergency preparedness and response  Conduct orientation of volunteers, chiefs and community groups on emergency preparedness and response; Ensure equality and non-discrimination in accessing services Ensure communities have access to health services through accountability mechanisms and remedies in situations where their rights have been, or are at risk of being breached; Work with government institutions to ensure key rights that are often implicated in public health emergencies include the right to health, the right to privacy and confidentiality; Support data management including compiling of community level reports; Facilitate mobilization of resources for the smooth implementation of the preparedness and response plan; Support the HSAs to identify risk groups in the community. Roles of Community Health Volunteers/Structures: Support community awareness on the emergency’s preparedness and response; Establish a two-way dialogue, which includes giving time to communities to explain their fears, ask questions, and have their questions answered with the support of his/her HSA or CHW regarding the emergency; Engage with lower-levels of the public who are in direct contact with the people targeted for the emergency preparedness and response messages on a daily basis; Support CHWs in rumour management and discourage stigma and discrimination  Support the HSAs to identify at risk individuals in the community; Work with HSAs and CHWs during household and community level activities; Support in compiling reports. Roles of Political Leaders: Ensure government policy and action allows for the direct and meaningful participation of communities on emergency preparedness and response issues  Support the emergency preparedness and response planning to operationalize the national plan at community level; Encourage that all measures are adhered to during the emergencies and response; Support community mobilization on adherence to all emergency and response messaging; Lobby and mobilize financial and material resources to support the delivery of preparedness and response plan activities  Roles of General Community Members: Communication of the emergency’s preparedness and response messages; Ensure adherence to the emergency and response messages from the MoH Assist in all public health intervention implemented in the community 7.1.4 Approaches for Risk Communication  The components needed for effective risk communication include: Health education Social mobilization Community engagement Mainline media and social media  Crisis communication e.g. outbreak communication Messaging: Information Education and Communication (IEC)  Behaviour Change Communication (BCC)) Rumour monitoring and managing Advocacy 7.1.5 Integrated Risk Communication Model Since risk communication is a complex activity involving different audiences, having an integrated approach in risk communication is very crucial. The key components for integrated emergency risk communication are indicated in Figure 1. This model allows for the successful design and implementation of an effective communication strategy. The model highlights the necessity of a collaborative approach between different target audiences across the board. ￼ Figure 1: An Integrated Model for emergency risk communication. 7.2 Key inter-linked Principles for Effective Communication: There are 5 key principles for effective communication as outlined below: Creating and Maintaining Trust  Building and maintaining trust is, arguably, the most important function of an effective communication during an outbreak or a public health event and should include:  Timely, transparent information regarding the nature of the threat,   The response to the event and  Actionable advice on protective actions people can take, linked to functioning services to increase self-efficacy This creates trust in the response, in the response teams and increases the likelihood that they follow the advice that is given. Trust is now considered the most important requirement for effective risk communication. According to the latest evidence, risk communication in health emergencies should include ensuring genuine participation of the population taking into account three key elements:  The understanding of that population’s specific context, concerns, beliefs, practices and traditions so as to shape scientific and logistic information, explanations that address community concerns (social science intelligence). Provision of understandable and trusted advice that they are likely to follow to save lives and bring the outbreak under control in the shortest possible time, in their own languages adapted to their educational levels and preferences (i.e. oral or visual), on channels and through interlocutors (intermediators) of their choice, (translational communication), and    Meaningful community engagement and the participation of (their) trusted interlocutors/messengers (means of dissemination) Trust is thus the currency for all public health interventions, and has, in an era of information overload, emerged as the critical element for effective risk communication (i.e. that the expert advice is acted on by key stakeholders and affected and at-risk populations). Risk communication should therefore aim at building, maintaining or restoring the trust of the public in those charged with the responsibility of managing the risk. The latest evidence highlights that to build trust, risk communication interventions should;  Be linked to functioning and accessible services. Be transparent and timely. Be easy to understand for target populations (i.e. in their preferred oral or visual forms; and in their own languages or dialects, targeted to their educational levels and cultural references). Acknowledge and communicate uncertainty (don’t over reassure, don’t speculate; but communicate frequently so that the evolution of an event and our understanding is transparent and not a cause of destroying trust).  Link to self-efficacy (can people really do what you ask them, do they have the ability, equipment, services, education they need to adopt our advice?). Be disseminated using multiple platforms, methods and channels.  Identify, involve and collaborate with people that the community trusts in decision-making and not just in information dissemination. This ensures that interventions and the communication about them are contextually appropriate and community-owned.  Timely announcements and transparency:  In most cases, public response to a health threat depends on the way the first and subsequent announcements are made. This necessitates announcing an event or threat as and when it emerges, even when the information is incomplete or changing fast.  This in turn implies that communicating uncertainty is a cornerstone of risk communication. Communication by authorities, response managers or front-line personnel must include; Information about the uncertainties associated with the risk, event and interventions Indicate what is known and not known at a particular moment in time A commitment, and follow up to keep people frequently informed and updated with the changing, uncertain situation Multiple platforms, mechanisms and trusted interlocutors to ensure that consistent and coordinated information reaches stakeholders and the population  Listening to, understanding and respecting public concerns Understanding public perceptions, concerns, fears and expectations is as critical for risk communication as understanding the risky practices and behaviours that affect risk.  The understanding of communities must start before and during an emergency. There are many ways to better listen to community concerns and understand their contexts that influence if the advice for corrective or preventive practices given to them will actually be accepted and acted upon. These include Knowledge, Attitude, Practice (KAP) surveys or mini-surveys; community walk-throughs, focus group discussions, key informant interviews, getting feedback from stakeholders, social media and media monitoring, etc. A serious attempt must be made to execute health interventions and health advices, based on evidence gathered using these methods and other social science approaches. Advance Planning  Risk communication is most effective when it is integrated with emergency preparedness, risk analysis and response (risk management). This means that a risk communication plan must be prepared during the preparedness stage. Emergency risk communication planning must occur in advance and be a continuous process with a focus on preparedness and prevention as well as response. Planning should be sensitive to stakeholders’ needs. It should be participatory, responsive to the context and incorporate feedback from affected groups.  The International Health Regulations (IHR) requires all governments to build national capacity for detection, alert and response to public health emergencies. One of the core capacities is risk communication. Accordingly, risk communication planning should include: The systems required (strategies, plans, SOPS, and mechanisms at national,  and district levels);  The coordination of partners, sectors, stakeholders;  Capacity for fast, effective public communication in languages and channels of the populations’ preference;  The ability to track and quickly manage concerns, perceptions, rumours and misinformation;  Communication engagement with affected and at-risk communities.  Ensuring Equity:  All citizens have a right to appropriate information about health risks, including what needs to be done in response to threats to their health. Unfortunately, large segments of society are excluded from routine communication about threats to health. Risk communication must therefore ensure equitable sharing of information to the public and avoid exclusion of marginalized members of society from health action. This means paying attention to the reach of communication, using trusted channels and interlocutors, not using jargon or technical language, use of peoples own languages and dialects, adapting messages to people’s levels of understanding and education; and ensuring that the actions promoted are those that people can realistically change. Special attention should be paid to analysing power dynamics in communities and taking special measures to reach those hardest to reach (women, minorities, the very old and young, people with disabilities, the poor, migrants and refugees, etc.).  7.3 Create an enabling environment for effective communication to the populations at risk Establish risk communication systems and structure at the national and district levels.  If not present, then establishing multi-sectoral communication committees/ structures across all levels i.e. National and District Levels (See Annex 7F for the examples of members of the communication subcommittee and roles). TORs can be expanded depending on the pre-outbreak, outbreak and post outbreak phase in line with each function. (See annex 7F for an expanded list of possible stakeholders). Reviewing the existing structure and mechanisms for risk communication. Ensure the communication system has a link to the community leadership structure as they have a strong impact to community. A quick assessment can be made to evaluate the framework for public health emergency risk communication and this can include:  Based on risk profile, carry out assessment to identify risk communication needs     Conduct mapping of risk communication stakeholders at all levels and develop database   Conduct resource mapping for risk communication Conduct mapping of languages and dialects; religions; preferred and trusted means, channels, and interlocutors (sources) for communication; traditional practices that are relevant for the top priority health risks and use this intelligence to shape risk communication strategies and plans. If not available, then at district, level, identify a government spokesperson and ensure they are trained in procedures for public communication. In addition to risk communication personnel, all frontline personnel should receive basic training in risk communication (surveillance, contact tracing, case management, social mobilization, community engagement, burial teams, health personnel, volunteers). Develop a Risk Communication Plan for Public Health Emergencies at the district as well as national level and ensure key stakeholders are oriented on the procedures for Risk Communication. Develop a coordination platform and mechanisms for internal and partner communication for engaging key stakeholders including media outlets; community radio networks; including roles and responsibilities. Have detailed budgets and advocate strongly for resources mobilization, and multi-sectoral collaboration to implement public health emergency and risk communication activities at all levels Create a system for dynamic Listening and Rumour Management  Note: Refer to annex 7E for checklist for monitoring risk communication 7.4 Communicating before, during and after the outbreak 7.4.1 Pre-Outbreak or Routine Risk Communication  A big proportion of communication activities should be implemented in the pre-emergency phase for better preparedness. People managing communication activities should take advantage of the absence of an emergency to build the country’s communication capacity and develop communication plans and tools to bring the nation to a high level of communication preparedness. The pre-emergency phase should also be used to develop the necessary communication messages and materials and promote practice of behaviours that can prevent the risk.  Before an outbreak, the following should take place: The Risk Communication and Community Engagement Sub-Committee for Risk Communication should meet at least once monthly or quarterly to;  Review the risk communication plan and required risk communication materials/logistics. Develop, pre-test, print and disseminate appropriate IEC materials based on the common public health risk.  Organize training of risk communication resource teams. Ensure communication coordination mechanism, is in place with clear terms, clear defined roles and responsibilities of each entity. Organize periodic interactions with stakeholders who will be involved in risk communication for prevention and preparedness or in response should an event or emergency occur.  This includes national or district media, community radios, civil society and stakeholders from other sectors for example, involve the animal health sector in countries where zoonotic influenzas are a priority threat.  Review past emergency communication interventions to draw lessons learned, build on successful practices and avoid negative ones.  Collect and analyse epidemiological and social data about periodic disasters and outbreaks; outbreak seasons of common diseases; expected at-risk communities/populations; as well as accessible and credible channels of communication. Build capacity for outbreak communication and identify/train spokesperson to be ready when an outbreak occurs.  Alert all relevant entities, and notify them on their role/s in case the expected outbreak occurs.  Ensure that messages and materials have been developed, pre-tested, and are ready for production and dissemination. Ensure that all required training modules, guidelines and monitoring checklists are developed and updated. Develop and share standard operating procedures (SOPs) for social mobilization and community engagement and ensure integration of risk communication in the overall emergency response plan. Identify and prepare database of stakeholders and partners, such as groups or organizations that focus on youth or women; schools, religious institutions, CSO, theatre groups and other community groups that can disseminate messages at the grassroots level and involve them in preparedness activities. Identify all the channels of communication available to spread the message and assess the reach and credibility of these channels. Produce a \\'Response Kit\\' which includes key frequently asked questions, media briefs, training manual, micro-planning tools, monitoring checklists/tools, communication plan templates and key IEC messages/materials for rapid distribution. This kit is for the use of communication practitioners at all levels. Establish communication lines with media; journalists, radio/TV stations; train them and keep them continuously up-dated. Pre-arrange activities with theatre groups, musicians and traditional community entertainers. Identify and train community health workers, community leaders, religious leaders, influential people, women’s groups, youth groups and other social mobilizers in SBCC and risk communication Identify mechanisms for communicating with hand-to-reach and vulnerable populations (older persons, persons with disabilities, children, the nomadic) and with people who are isolated, in order to ensure that they will have access to health protection information and assistance Define communication channels to be used to reach vulnerable groups. Disseminate messages that describe actions that the government is taking to protect the public and health care workers, promote awareness of the coming health threat and preventive behaviours and actions that individuals, families and communities can take to reduce the risk and this can be done through mass media e.g. local community radios, public health address, community drama groups, Television, print media, social media e.g. Facebook, websites, twitter, etc. Conduct community engagement activities and build trusted relationships between those in authority and communities through training, dialogue, consultations, capacity building. It is important to note that effective community engagement relies on having trusted relationships between those in authority and communities, so use every opportunity to strengthen these relationships in “peacetimes” etc. Use ongoing health education, health promotion and other means to create, test and build trust in the systems, interlocutors that can be used in emergencies for risk communication.  Make arrangements for a hotline facility, which can be started immediately when the emergency occurs. Establish a media monitoring team to monitor the news and social media. Maintain and update list of media houses. Develop plans for routine monitoring of misinformation and rumours and set up a media monitoring system for keeping track of behaviours and practices related to the emergency Note that: It is important to integrate to the extent possible, social science data that should be gathered too. Data on the context, socio-cultural information (including education, traditional practices, health seeking and health care giving behaviour, and beliefs) relevant to priority hazards and epidemic prone disease should also be obtained. This will help epidemiological data to be contextualized and for real intelligence, be created basing on the risks and shape possible health interventions. It is important to organize periodic interactions with stakeholders who will be involved in risk communication for prevention and preparedness or in response should an event or emergency occur. This includes national media, community radios, civil society and stakeholders from other sectors for example, involve the animal health sector in countries where zoonotic influenzas are a priority threat.  7.4.2 During Outbreak Response During an outbreak response, and when the public is at risk of a real or potential health threat, treatment options may be limited, direct interventions may take time to organize and resources may be few. Communicating advice and guidance, therefore, often stands as the most important public health tool in managing a risk. The focus of outbreak communication is to promote outbreak control and mitigate disruption to society by communicating with the public in ways that build, maintain or restore trust. Pro-active communication encourages the public to adopt protective behaviours, facilitates heightened disease surveillance, reduces confusion and fear and allows for a better use of resources, all of which are necessary for an effective response. Pro/active communication also shows that health authorities are in control of the situation and care about the public and build trust between them and the community at large. People have a fundamental right to information and to participation. In addition to the public health objectives, remember that people have a right to information on protective actions and they have a right to participate in and shape interventions that are acceptable to them.  Figure 7.1 illustrates a typical epidemic curve which tracks number of cases over time that could occur during an infectious disease outbreak. The yellow area represents the number of cases which could be avoided with the control opportunity of a rapid response to the threat. The blue arrow indicates the point at which proactive communication plays a crucial role in supporting such a rapid response. By alerting a population and partners to an infectious disease risk, surveillance of potential cases increases, protective behaviours are adopted, confusion is limited and communication resources are more likely to be focused. Effective communication can help limit the spread of a disease and ultimately save lives. It also minimizes damage to societies and economies and can help communities recover faster from a health event or emergency.   ￼ Figure 7.1: Epidemic curve showing the importance of Proactive communication  7.4.2.1 Identify and coordinate partners and other stakeholders during an outbreak Outbreaks usually create fear in the community. Involvement of several different stakeholders sometimes leads to uncoordinated and duplication of effort. Provision of timely and accurate information through a well-coordinated mechanism is important.  Internal coordination of communication among national stakeholders is key during an emergency.  The “Risk Communication and Social Mobilization Subcommittee” which has been described in Section 5, has the responsibility of ensuring that there is an internal communication system among national stakeholders to ensure information flows to different government sectors on time. Partner coordination is another key element during an outbreak and event response and is aimed at fostering ownership, effective participation of key players and efficient use of resources. (See annex 7F for the potential partners and stakeholders who can be involved). It establishes routine communication structures among health workers, community and partners. It helps ensure that this vital link is available and functional during an emergency. If the national or district level has a Risk Communication and Community Engagement Plan, these would have been addressed in the Plan. Coordination helps ensure that messages reaching the population are consistent and not contradictory or confusing and thereby promote trust and the likelihood that expert advice will be followed.  The PHEMC through the PHEOC or through a similar coordination structure at national level may take responsibility for ensuring communications are consistent and reflect the data that has been analysed. Ensure the focus of the communication activities are transparent and accurate, and take into account community experiences and expectations regarding the outbreak.  Distinguish between communication with stakeholders who are experts and those who are part of the response and require a more layman’s description and explanation. They and other important interlocutors such as the media and civil society (and the general population) will require targeted and adapted products and messages. This means that carefully segmenting and targeting audiences, adapting materials, messages and mechanism to suit each of them is essential.  7.4.2.2 Communicate with the affected community and stakeholders Communication with affected communities and stakeholders, including the media is essential during outbreak and event response. Thus, establishing routine communication structures and processes between the health and community partners helps to ensure that this vital link is available and functional during an emergency. Options for communicating between the various partners can range from press releases, press conferences, television and radio messages, meetings (health personnel, community, religious, opinion and political leaders); Educational and communication materials (posters, fliers); Multi-media presentations (for example, films, video or narrated slide presentations) at the markets, health centres, schools, women’s and other community groups, service organizations, religious centres, local community media, Social media (Facebook, Twitter, WhatsApp, etc.), SMS, telephone, hand-carried message, Community drama groups/play group; site visits; fax, email updates and exchanges of communication materials to more formal decision-making committees. Regardless of the mechanism, ensure that the focus is on transparent and trustworthy communication that considers community experiences. Ensure the messages are; Clear and understandable to the audience: What, why and how it is happening? What threats to health exist or are likely to occur? What should the public do? Where can people get services or information? What assurances can be given? Are the messages written in an understandable language and to the levels of understanding of the audience? Research shows that risk should not be explained in technical terms. Consider these factors when providing messages: Who is your audience? What do you want your audience to do after provision of this message? Do they have the enabling environment to do as advised? Are there functioning and accessible services that enable them to follow the advice?  Promote Dialogue: Promote real time two-way communication exchange; listen to audience’s concerns and respond appropriately rather than just informing.  Demonstrate empathy and caring:  Are you showing empathy for their suffering? Are you being too cold and clinical? Are you respectful? Harmonized and Consistent messages: Ensure that consistent messaging goes to the public notwithstanding the different partners involved in dissemination of information. Use message maps and other tools to keep the same frame and logic for the messaging but allow partners to adapt to the context of more segmented audiences. Are messages consistent regardless of who is issuing them? Inconsistent or conflicting messages create confusion and destroy trust in the response and authorities.  Establish a mechanism of continuous collation of facts and figures of the public heath event Update public information message and share it with players involved in information dissemination  Relevance: Communicate data/information that best illustrate your point and factors their concerns. Use examples that relate to the audience.  NB: Consider pre-testing the messages from similar settings before dissemination In case of rumours, quickly respond to them and any inaccuracies in general and especially within the specific audience where they have occurred. Consider setting up a rumour monitoring system.  Widespread damaging rumours should be counteracted through public statements or press conferences.  Provide comprehensive information to prevent rumours being generated from your response.  Build, maintain and restore trust as you communicate and be as courteous as possible in your communication. Give health education messages to trusted and respected community leaders and ask them to transmit to the community. Only authorized and credible persons should communicate during crisis period. On a regular basis Public Health Emergency Response Team officers should meet with the Local Leaders to give:  Frequent, up-to-date information on the outbreak and response  Clear and simple health messages for the media  Clear instructions to communicate to the media only the information and health education messages from the PHEMC 7.4.2.3 Distribute IEC material and develop fact sheets Fact sheets are brief summaries of 1 to 2 pages. They are usually prepared by health staff for consumption by the general public and deal with a single topic or message. For example, a fact sheet on a Shigella outbreak in a district may contain the following information for the community; the cause of Shigella, how it is transmitted, steps for prevention and updates on the number of cases and deaths. The fact sheets could be posted on a bulletin board or distributed to community groups that are planning health education campaigns. Where possible transform the fact sheets into audio products (audio files, short audio recordings on a phone, or scripts, and into visual products (like posters or infographics). These can be used depending on the preference of the audience for audio (oral or visual/written/illustrated communication). See attached Example in the Annex 7A. Distribute also other IEC materials, which have been prepared. Ensure they have been pre-tested with the target audience to ensure comprehension and meaning.  7.4.2.4 Develop and distribute public health situation reports during outbreaks In many countries, the national level or region/province publishes a national public health bulletin, but during outbreak, these reports will be produced more regularly and describe the outbreak including the trend i.e. situation reports (Sitrep). These situation reports or bulletins have a wider audience than just the health staff in a particular district or health facility. They are usually brief (2 to 8 pages). They are seen by policy makers, legislators and other decision-makers. They are valuable channels for reaching technical and donor partners. The bulletins contain at least: A summary table showing the number of reported cases and deaths to date for each priority disease A commentary or message on a given disease or topic Inclusion of any relevant social science data on risky practices, behaviours and other factors.   If a national public health situation report is sent to the district office, display it where everyone can see it. Make copies and distribute to health facility staff. Take a copy of the report with you on your next supervisory visit to show health workers how data produced during outbreak contributes to public health. (A sample template for preparing a situation report is in Annex 7C). 7.4.2.5 Communicating to media  The media is a major influence and should be seen as a partner in risk communication. However, the media is often associated with political parties or private interests and can therefore have biases of their own. They are also able to find and report on people’s concerns, sensationalize stories and may not always be based on facts and evidence. Therefore, it is essential to meet regularly with, brief and educate the media on priority hazards and on response systems, and provides them with appropriate information so as to cultivate a respectful and trusted relationship with them. Media will enable a wider dissemination of messages on radio or other appropriate means.  As part of your risk communication plan, determine how you will announce news of the outbreak and then how you will keep the media regularly informed. Often, regular press releases and media briefings are appropriate tools for communicating with the media. If the emergency is complex, convening a workshop with targeted media is helpful to ensure correct information is disseminated, as most journalists have not been trained in medicine or public health. In addition, it is good to develop media kits which could include fact sheets and community messages about the priority diseases and events.  Ensure prior to the outbreak you have reached out to media and identified the key outlets you will need to work with during an outbreak. It is also good prior to an emergency, to identify the clearance process for media products and appreciate the following: Ensuring prompt and frequent access to experts, officials and spokespersons who will speak authoritatively and credibly on the issue at hand.  Provide media training for spokespersons. Spokespersons must be the ones who could speak in lay language and explain scientific ideas and terms well; those who do not speak in technical language; and those who illustrate the information with easy-to-understand stories or examples. Talking points could be used, with messages as simple as possible and the talking points should have latest information. Please ensure that spokespersons identified could also communicate the uncertainty in an evolving event well, and admit when they don’t know something. Community case definitions and job aids will aid the spokesperson to deliver correct messages. Promptly answering journalists` calls as a show of respecting them Give them accurate and well explained information.  Give exclusive stories and interviews to provide a different perspective Provide human interest stories Give them clear easy to use handouts (written, audio, visual or audio-visual) NB: Release information to the media only through the spokesperson to make sure that the community receives clear and consistent information.  Ensure monitoring the media daily to see how the outbreak is being reported. Include social media in your monitoring strategy. If you feel that the wrong messages are being disseminated, devise a strategy for how to correct this misinformation. 7.4.2.6 Communicating to health workers Ensure you communicate regularly with the health workers by providing correct information pertaining the outbreak. It is important to communicate with health staff from different levels about the data sent (including any gaps), results of the analysis of these data and measures that are taken to respond to the potential public health event which they have reported. Communication can also include providing participating healthcare workers with any outbreak or event response reports for future reference.  Make sure that health workers provide correct information of number of cases and any death that has occurred. Also, ensure you provide any changing information regarding case management or any other response intervention Encourage health workers to keep themselves updated, in real-time during an event or emergency using reliable sources such the PHIM bulletins or the WHO’s knowledge transfer platform (www.OpenWHO.org)  on common, re-emerging and emerging epidemic-prone disease and on risk communication. Increasingly during emergency response to disease outbreaks, WHO will provide real-time online, off-line or face-to-face training to update healthcare workers and response teams. These provide an opportunity for knowledge and skills updating or for acquiring new knowledge or skills.   7.4.3 After or Post Outbreak Response 7.4.3.1 Prepare an outbreak or event response report After an outbreak or event response has taken place, district staff who led the investigation should prepare a report. The purpose of the report is to document how the problem was identified, investigated, responded to, what the outcome was, decision taken and recommendations made. Make sure that the health unit that reported the initial cases receives a copy of the report. See Annex 7B and Annex 7D at the end of this section for an example of a recommended format and sample. 7.4.3.2 Evaluate lessons learned in order to strengthen appropriate public responses to similar emergencies in the future. Assess the effectiveness of the communications team in each phase and area of work. Assess the effectiveness of meetings. Assess the effectiveness of the internal flow of communications. Assess the monitoring of communications and of the media. Assess the response of the communications media. Assess the outputs and outcomes of risk communication and community engagement  7.4.3.3 Periodic testing of the Risk Communication Plan Carry out simulations to test risk communication plan in order to detect possible weaknesses or gaps that need to be corrected before an emergency. Revise the plan based on lessons learnt from the simulation exercise, AAR (After Action Reviews) or other assessment done. WHO provides ready-made desk top and other simulation exercises on the www-OpenWHO.org 7.5 Annexes to Section 7 Annex 7A: \\tSample Fact Sheet Annex 7B:\\tSample district outbreak report Annex 7C:\\tTemplate for preparing public health event situation report Annex 7D:\\tOutbreak Investigation report sample Annex 7E:\\tIHR core capacity monitoring questionnaire for risk communication Annex 7 F:  \\tList of Stakeholders and Partners for risk communication Annex 7A: Fact Sheet Influenza A Virus General information about Avian Influenza A Virus Infections in Humans (Reference http://www.who.int/influenza/human_animal_interface/faq_H7N9/en/) Influenza A H7 viruses are a group of influenza viruses that normally circulate among birds. The influenza A (H7N9) virus is one subgroup among the larger group of H7 viruses. Although some H7 viruses (H7N2, H7N3 and H7N7) have occasionally been found to infect humans, no human infections with H7N9 viruses have been reported until recent reports from China. What are the main symptoms of human infection with influenza A (H7N9) virus? Thus far, most patients with this infection have had severe pneumonia. Symptoms include fever, cough and shortness of breath. However, information is still limited about the full spectrum of disease that infection with influenza A (H7N9) virus might cause. Why is this virus infecting humans now? We do not know the answer to this question yet, because we do not know the source of exposure for these human infections. However, analysis of the genes of these viruses suggests that although they have evolved from avian (bird) viruses, they show signs of adaption to growth in mammalian species. These adaptations include an ability to bind to mammalian cells, and to grow at temperatures close to the normal body temperature of mammals (which is lower than that of birds). What is known about previous human infections with H7 influenza viruses globally? From 1996 to 2012, human infections with H7 influenza viruses (H7N2, H7N3, and H7N7) were reported in the Netherlands, Italy, Canada, United States of America, Mexico and the United Kingdom. Most of these infections occurred in association with poultry outbreaks. The infections mainly resulted in conjunctivitis and mild upper respiratory symptoms, with the exception of one death, which occurred in the Netherlands. Until now, no human infections with H7 influenza viruses have been reported in China. Is the influenza A (H7N9) virus different from influenza A (H1N1) and A (H5N1) viruses? Yes. All three viruses are influenza A virus but they are distinct from each other. H7N9 and H5N1 are considered animal influenza viruses that sometimes infect people. H1N1 viruses can be divided into those that normally infect people and those that normally infect animals. How did people become infected with the influenza A (H7N9) virus? Some of the confirmed cases had contact with animals or with an animal environment. The virus has been found in a pigeon in a market in Shanghai. It is not yet known how persons became infected. The possibility of animal-to-human transmission is being investigated, as is the possibility of person-to-person transmission. How can infection with influenza A (H7N9) virus be prevented? Although both the source of infection and the mode of transmission are uncertain, it is prudent to follow basic hygienic practices to prevent infection. They include hand and respiratory hygiene and food safety measures;  Hand hygiene;  Wash your hands before, during and after you prepare food; before you eat; after you use the toilet; after handling animals or animal waste; when your hands are dirty; and when providing care when someone in your home is sick.  Hand hygiene will also prevent the transmission of infections to yourself (from touching contaminated surfaces) and in hospitals to patients, health care workers and others.  Wash your hands with soap and running water when visibly dirty; if not visibly dirty, wash your hands with soap and water or use an alcohol-based hand cleanser.  Respiratory hygiene; Cover your mouth and nose with a medical mask, tissue, or a sleeve or flexed elbow when coughing or sneezing; throw the used tissue into a closed bin immediately after use; perform hand hygiene after contact with respiratory secretions. Is it safe to eat meat, i.e. poultry and pork products? Influenza viruses are not transmitted through consuming well-cooked food. Because influenza viruses are inactivated by normal temperatures used for cooking (so that food reaches 70°C in all parts— \"piping\" hot — no \"pink\" parts), it is safe to eat properly prepared and cooked meat, including from poultry and game birds. Diseased animals and animals that have died of diseases should not be eaten. In areas experiencing outbreaks, meat products can be safely consumed provided that these items are properly cooked and properly handled during food preparation. The consumption of raw meat and uncooked blood-based dishes is a high-risk practice and should be discouraged. Is it safe to visit live markets and farms in areas where human cases have been recorded? If you visit live markets, avoid direct contact with live animals and surfaces which are in contact with animals. If you live on a farm and raise animals for food, such as pigs and poultry, be sure to keep children away from sick and dead animals; keep animal species separated as much as possible; and report immediately to local authorities any cases of sick and dead animals. Sick or dead animals should not be butchered and prepared for food. Is there a vaccine for the influenza A (H7N9) virus? No vaccine for the prevention of influenza A (H7N9) infections is currently available. However, viruses have already been isolated and characterized from the initial cases. The first step in development of a vaccine is the selection of candidate viruses that could go into a vaccine. WHO, in collaboration with partners, will continue to characterize available influenza A (H7N9) viruses to identify the best candidate viruses. These candidate vaccine viruses can then be used for the manufacture of vaccine if this step becomes necessary. Does treatment exist for influenza A (H7N9) infection? Laboratory testing conducted in China has shown that the influenza A (H7N9) viruses are sensitive to the anti-influenza drugs known as neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). When these drugs are given early in the course of illness, they have been found to be effective against seasonal influenza virus and influenza A(H5N1) virus infection. However, at this time, there is no experience with the use of these drugs for the treatment of H7N9 infection. Is the general population at risk from the influenza A (H7N9) virus? We do not yet know enough about these infections to determine whether there is a significant risk of community spread. This possibility is the subject of epidemiological investigations that are now taking place. Are health care workers at risk from the influenza A (H7N9) influenza virus? Health care workers often come into contact with patients with infectious diseases. Therefore, WHO recommends that appropriate infection prevention and control measures be consistently applied in health care settings, and that the health status of health care workers be closely monitored. Together with standard precautions, health care workers caring for those suspected or confirmed to have influenza A(H7N9) infection should use additional precautions  Does this influenza virus pose a pandemic threat? Any animal influenza virus that develops the ability to infect people is a theoretical risk to cause a pandemic. However, whether the influenza A(H7N9) virus could actually cause a pandemic is unknown. Other animal influenza viruses that have been found to occasionally infect people have not gone on to cause a pandemic. Preventing Human Infection with Avian Influenza A Viruses The best way to prevent infection with avian influenza A virus is to avoid sources of exposure. Most human infections with avian influenza A viruses have occurred following direct or close contact with infected poultry. Seasonal influenza vaccination will not prevent infection with avian influenza A virus, but can reduce the risk of co-infection with human and avian influenza A virus. Because rare episodes of limited, non-sustained human-to-human transmission of HPAI H5N1 virus has been reported, persons should avoid sick patients who have suspected or confirmed HPAI H5N1 virus infection.  Health care personnel caring for patients with suspected or confirmed HPAI H5N1 virus infection should wear recommended personal protective equipment and follow recommended infection control measures (standard, droplet, contact, and airborne precautions).

The disease commonly affects wild and domestic herbivores, human and carnivores are incidental hosts. Three occurrence forms of the disease in human include cutaneous, inhalation and gastrointestinal anthrax. The transmission of the disease can be through intestine (ingestion), Respiratory (inhalation) and skin (cutaneous) from infected animal tissues and from infected person. The worldwide estimate of the disease burden is not well known; however occasional epidemics do occur (WHO 2005) An outbreak of anthrax in in Mwansambo, Nkhotakota District, was reported to the Ministry of Health (MoH) by the Director of Health and Social Services (DHSS). Therefore, there was a need to carry out an investigation to ascertain what was happening in the affected district. Objectives of the Outbreak investigation The objectives of the investigation were; To confirm and determine the magnitude of the outbreak by actively searching for cases To characterize the outbreak in terms of time, place and persons To identify the source of infection through collection of both animal and clinical samples To generate and test the hypotheses of the outbreaks To come up with the recommendations and assist the district teams to respond and control the outbreak. Hypothesis for the Anthrax outbreak District Slaughtering of the dead cow due to anthrax is associated with contracting a disease in human Handling/eating of meat from a dead cow due to anthrax is associated with contracting a disease in human. 2.\\tMETHODOLOGY This was a cross-sectional study that involved the patients presenting with signs and symptoms for anthrax who were either admitted or at home. Active case search in the community was done to identify the cases. Clinical samples were collected and transported to the Laboratory for confirmation. Study area: The suspected anthrax outbreak occurred in Kaigwazanga Village in Mphimbi Ward in Nkhotakota District and Sambani Village in Dowa District; both the districts are located in Central Region in Malawi.  Places visited We identified the homes of the cases that sought treatment from Mwansambo Health Centre and Nthondo Health Centre, through assistance of the National IDSR focal person, DHSS (Nkhotakota and Dowa Districts respectively), District Veterinary Officers (Nkhotakota and Dowa Districts respectively) and Community leaders. We visited two most affected villages i.e. Sahani and Kaigwazanga. Study period: The outbreak investigation was carried out from 8 - 14, January, 2015.  Case definition used: The standard case definitions that were used to identify the cases were;   Suspected Anthrax case\\ufdd0IF THERE IS Anthrax EPIDEMIC: Any resident of Mwansambo presenting with a clinical illness, in a person who is epidemiologically linked to a confirmed or suspected animal case or contaminated animal product from 12th December 2015.\\ufdd0Probable Anthrax case definition\\ufdd0Any resident of Mwansambo presenting with cutaneous ulcers developing within two weeks of coming into contact with a sick or dead animal, confirmed to have anthrax of dying of unknown diseases since 12th December 2015\\ufdd0Confirmed Anthrax case definition\\ufdd0A suspected case or a probable case in whom laboratory testing confirms Bacillus anthracis by Gram Staining or culture or PCR  Data collection methods: Semi structured questionnaire were used to get information from patients and their families. Where the patient was not available or could not speak, a knowledgeable proxy was used. 3.\\tFINDINGS Kaigwazanga Village, Nkhotakota, Central Region The index case reported at the Mwansambo Health Centre on 6/12/2015. The index case (Kenneth Mbwibwi) was a male of 39 years living in Kaigwazanga Village in Mwansambo, Mphimbi Ward. The index case is the son of the owner of the dead cow. (This family had one cow and one goat).  This outbreak is said to have occurred after the slaughtering of the dead cow. It was noted that the cow died on 3/12/2015, the family did not notify the veterinary officer for inspection, the cow was slaughtered at home by Kenneth with the help of a neighbour called Guza who also distributed the meat to the relatives and neighbours. The cow skin was given to the dogs. The second day on 4/12/2015, the index case was slaughtering the head part of the dead cow and accidentally he pricked one of his finger with the cow bones. On 6/12/2015, the index case had a swollen finger (the pricked finger). On 7/12/2015, the goat died and was slaughtered by the index case, the goat meat was eaten by only the family members. On 8/12/2015 the index case realised that the hand that was pricked was swollen, he was rushed to Mwansambo Health Centre. In charge of the health centre suspected the patient with Anthrax and he administered the patient with Amoxicillin for five days and pain killers. After few days without recovering, on 12/12/2015 he went back to the hospital and he presented with swelling on the right upper limb (RUL) and chest, massive swelling of the RUL and chest with eschar on the wound.  The In-Charge (Mwansambo HC) referred him to Nkhotakota District Hospital. ￼ Photo 1: A photo showing a lesion in a hand of the index case identified in Kaigwazanga Village, Nkhotakota District Sambani Village, Dowa District, Central Region The first case in Dowa District was reported on 17/12/2015, this is a male, 25 years of age who lives in Sambani Village in the district. This case was brought to the Nthondo Health Centre while unconscious and he had blisters and lesions in his arms. This case was involved in selling the meat of the cow that was slaughtered after death.  The community was notified on presence of anthrax outbreak on 22/12/2015. The community was also informed that for those who might have contacted or ate the infected meat needed go to the hospital. From 23/12/2015 to 28/12/2015 there were a total of 760 people who presented to the hospital and they were all treated with either Doxycycline (7 days) or Amoxilin (5 days) In Dowa District there were four deaths of cows that were identified, the team was able to trace three cows that died and the cows were slaughtered and meat was sold at one of the butcheries. It was also found that the meat was not inspected by the Veterinary Officer. One household had its cow inspected, but we found that the person who did the inspection was an Artificial Inseminator not a Vet Officer and he had no knowledge on how to inspect cattle. A total of 904 contacts that were linked to the infected meat were obtained, (68 were linked to the dead cow in Kaigwazanga Village, Nkhotakota whereas a total of 836 contacts were obtained in Dowa District. Among all the 904 contacts, 23 subjects met the standard case definition and there was no death reported. The median age for the cases was 36 years with the youngest being I year old and the oldest 98 years old. Age group 10-19 years constituted 29.1% of the cases. Other social demographic characteristics for the contacts and cases are as shown in Table 1 and 2 below.

Among the 23 patients of anthrax, 3 (13%) were hospitalized.  Infectivity rate was 23/904 (2.5%).  The most presenting symptoms was fever as shown in Figure 2 below Other findings The National team worked hand in hand with veterinary officers who claimed that there were a lot of cattle that were not vaccinated, therefore the vaccination coverage is quite low; few cows within the village were presented for the vaccination. The community mentioned not to be able to afford the vaccination fee of MK2000 per one cow and MK1000 per goat. The community was not well informed about anthrax and how to handle the sick and dying animals 4.\\tMeasures taken Quarantine of meat and meat products was imposed in the affected areas Vaccination of cows against anthrax and will focus in the affected wards Provision of education to the community through the village meetings, churches, mosques, schools. The community leaders were present to address the crowd All the cases that presented to the hospital with cutaneous lesions were treated and prophylaxis was given to all the identified contacts (prophylaxis of Doxycycline (7 days) and some were given Amoxicillin (5 days) The DVO, DHSS and the Ministry of Health officers conducted a joint meeting for more discussion came up with different interventions. Disinfection to the cow sheds and slaughtering sites was done using lime stone powder 5.\\tChallenges Vaccination coverage was quite low; few cows within the villages were presented for vaccination. This was a result of shortage of vaccines The community was not well informed about anthrax and how to handle the dying animals A close link between the DHSS and the DVO is lacking until when zoonotic outbreaks appear 6.\\tRecommendations The veterinary sector should intensify vaccination program by increasing the coverage and providing regular and timely vaccines to livestock especially against zoonotic diseases which are prone to epidemics The community should be well informed about anthrax and other zoonotic and how to handle the dying animals. There should be a close link between the DHSS and the DVO in dealing with zoonotic; this will ensure a One Health approach. Animal preliminary tests for diagnosis should be a basic thing to start with before anything else; this will give a clue of what we are dealing with 7.\\tConclusion The outbreak of Anthrax in Central Region was established through the laboratory confirmation from human case and the cattle. All the cases were linked to the dead cows making that a cause for an outbreak. Slaughtering and handling of meat to the dead cows were the major risk factors for acquiring the disease in human. The outbreak was declared over on 14th January 2016.

However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats.  The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi subsequently adapted in 2014. Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. Emerging and re-emerging diseases and conditions pose a threat to the country’s health security.  Responding to health emergencies remains a major challenge, as shown by recent health emergencies in the country as well as the African region, the unprecedented Ebola Virus Disease of 2014, the ongoing Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic. Specifically, challenges in capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats have been identified. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using the Third Edition of the guidelines for IDSR as revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018 and adapted to our context in 2020. It is worth noting that, many Public Health Events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate. To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to  implement these IDSR technical guidelines. These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Therefore, it is important that we scale up and fully implement this third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in the country as they explicitly describe what needs to be established at each level of the health system in order to detect, confirm and respond to diseases, conditions and health events that are responsible for  illness, deaths and disability in local communities. The cost of good public health surveillance as a public health good is relatively very low compared to many other strategies. Let us all embrace these IDSR technical guidelines to strengthen capacities for preparedness, alert and response for health security in the country. These guidelines are to be used by all relevant multisectoral stakeholders at all levels as general reference for surveillance activities, set of standard definitions for threshold levels that initiate action for responding to specific diseases, stand-alone reference for level-specific responsibilities, resource for developing training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of surveillance activities, and as a guide for improving early detection and response of epidemic prone diseases. Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.

The section also provides guidance on how IDSR works, the objectives of IDSR, and how IDSR can help to build and sustain the International Health Regulation (IHR) core capacities, thereby facilitating the implementation of IHR.  Furthermore, this section introduces other aspects such as; the One Health approach; the linkage between Disaster Risk Management (DRM) and IDSR; the core surveillance functions; how sub-national levels (for example districts) can use these guidelines to strengthen surveillance and response; the roles and responsibilities of the various actors at different levels; and finally, the priority diseases, conditions and events recommended in Malawi IDSR.  It is important to emphasize from the onset that these guidelines are to help build and strengthen surveillance systems for priority diseases, conditions and all other public health events, whether they are known or unknown, whether they are disease events or other IHR hazards.  These guidelines are NOT limited to only known diseases.  1.2 Public Health Surveillance Public Health Surveillance is the ongoing systematic identification, collection, collation, analysis, and interpretation of disease occurrence and public health event data to take timely and robust action. It includes the timely dissemination of the resulting information to those who need to know for effective and appropriate action. Surveillance is also essential for planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of public health practice. Malawi has decided to achieve its public health surveillance objectives through the implementation of the IDSR strategy. 1.2.1 Definition of the different types/approaches of public health surveillance Passive surveillance:\\xa0A system by which, a health institution receives routine reports submitted from health facilities (hospitals, clinics, public health units, or community or other sources). There is no active search for cases. This is the most common, and it includes the surveillance of diseases and other public health events using routine surveillance; routine Health Management and Information System (HMIS) or any other public health information system, Active surveillance:\\xa0 It involves an ongoing search for cases in the community or the health facilities. This may involve regular contacts with key reporting sources, such as telephone calls to health care workers at a facility or laboratory or physically moving to the source and records review of data. Examples include active search of cases of measles and polio, as well as during outbreaks where one must institute mechanisms for active finding of additional cases.  Integrated Disease Surveillance: It is an approach that aims at collecting health data for multiple diseases using standardized tools. To ensure robust early warning and prompt response, the IDSR data collection and analysis system relies on two main channels of information or signal generation, namely: 1) Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) and 2) Event-Based Surveillance (EBS). 1.2.1.1 Indicator-based surveillance  Indicator-based surveillance is the systematic (regular) identification, collection, monitoring, analysis and interpretation of structured data, such as indicators produced by a number of well-identified, mostly health facility-based, formal sources. What are the common methods of indicator-based surveillance? Facility-based surveillance: All reporting units (e.g., health facilities) are required to report on a weekly, monthly, quarterly or annual basis to the next level based on the categories of the diseases, conditions and events. Additionally, they are also required to report immediately, any epidemic prone disease to the next level. Case based surveillance: Case-based surveillance involves the ongoing and rapid identification of identifiable cases for purposes of case follow-up. It is the type of surveillance used for diseases that are targeted for elimination or eradication or during confirmed outbreaks. In these scenarios, every individual case identified is reported immediately, using a case based form to the next level Sentinel surveillance: This type of surveillance is done for specific conditions in a specific cohort such as in a geographical area or population subgroup to estimate trends in a larger population. A given number of health facilities or reporting sites are usually designated as sentinel sites for monitoring rate of occurrence of priority events such as pandemic or epidemic events and other Public Health Events (PHEs) of public health importance and they act as early warning and reporting sites. Sentinel sites are usually designated because they are representative of an area or are in an area of likely risk for a disease or condition of concern. Examples of sentinel surveillance include: sentinel surveillance for Influenza, Rotavirus, Paediatric Bacterial Meningitis (PBM) and environmental sewage sampling for polio. Syndromic surveillance:\\xa0An active or passive system that uses Standard Case Definitions based entirely on clinical features without any laboratory diagnosis. Few examples include; - collecting the number of cases of Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) as an alert for polio; or acute watery diarrhoea among people aged two years and older as an alert for cholera; or \"rash illness\" as an alert for measles; or Acute Haemorrhagic Fever (AHF) as an alert for viral haemorrhagic diseases, or Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) or Influenza-Like Illness (ILI) as alerts for influenza. Because of the lack of specificity of this system, reports require more investigation from higher levels.  Laboratory-based surveillance: This consists of surveillance conducted at laboratories for detecting events or trends that may not be seen as a problem at other locations or that originates from laboratory testing mainly done routinely or used when conducting sentinel surveillance. Laboratories can be the source of an initial alert for a specific outbreak or public health event that necessitates further epidemiological investigations. For example, the laboratory may be the first to detect the emergence of resistant strains in the community such as multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). Other examples of laboratory-based surveillance include virological surveillance as influenza and bacteriological surveillance such as Antimicrobial resistance surveillance system. Recently, WHO has established a Global Antimicrobial Resistance Surveillance System (GLASS), which is a surveillance system for clinical specimens and is focusing initially on priority human bacterial infections namely E. coli, K. pneumonia, S. aureus, S. pneumoniae, Salmonella spp., Shigella spp and N. gonorrheae. This type of laboratory surveillance provides information about antimicrobial resistance incidence, prevalence, and trends. Malawi is part of GLASS and is currently monitoring the priority bacterial infections listed above in 9 sites across the country. Disease-specific surveillance: This involves surveillance activities aimed at targeted health data for a specific disease for vertical surveillance. Examples include Tuberculosis, Malaria and HIV surveillance systems. Community Based Surveillance (CBS):  Defined as the systematic detection and reporting of events of public health significance within the community by community members. CBS incorporates both Indicator-based and Event-based surveillance methods.  In CBS, there are identified focal person(s) e.g. Community volunteer who report cases or events to the designated focal point, Health Surveillance Assistants (HSA) within the nearby local health delivery points. Community based surveillance strategies focus on two approaches to collect community information. The first one relies on identifying and reporting events based on agreed indicators (lay case definitions). For example, trusted community members are trained to identify diseases such as measles, cholera, polio and Neonatal Tetanus, using community (lay) case definitions and use standardized reporting system to the next level. The second strategy relies on reporting of unusual events (alerts) which can alert early stages of an outbreak or any other public health threat in the community. Alerts may capture a wide variety of unusual events emerging at the community level and information from these alerts may be incomplete and unconfirmed and as such they all need to be triaged and verified.  Information using this strategy can also come from people who have already been oriented on the agreed indicators (lay case definitions) for example the community volunteers, or may be any other representatives from the community, who have been oriented to detect events like unusual animal deaths and report to the next level. Often Village Health Committees (VHCs) would link the patient identified through any of the strategies, to nearby health facility and can help identify contacts.  1.2.1.2 Event- Based Surveillance (EBS) Event-based surveillance is the organized and rapid capture of information about events that are of potential risk to public health. Information is initially captured as an alert which is considered by the Early Warning Alert and Response system as an alert representing potential acute risk to human health, such as an outbreak. All alerts may not necessarily become real events, as such they all need to be triaged and verified before a response is initiated. Alerts which may signify potential risks may include: Occurrence of disease in humans, such as unexplained clustered cases of a disease or syndromes, unusual disease patterns or unexpected deaths as recognized by health workers and other key informants in the community;  Events related to potential exposure for humans, such as events related to diseases and deaths in animals, contaminated food products or water, and environmental hazards including chemical and radio-nuclear events. Alerts of potential exposure of human beings by biological, chemical or radiological and nuclear hazards, or occurrence of natural or man-made disasters.  Event based surveillance also involves media monitoring and this entails the regular scanning of- newspapers, internet sites and media alert systems e.g. ProMed, blogs, social media, newspapers, radios, and television.  Event based Surveillance systems are very sensitive. Information received through event-based surveillance should be synchronized with IBS and rapidly assessed for the risk the event poses to public health and responded to appropriately (illustrated in Figure 1). Unlike indicator-based surveillance, event-based surveillance is not based on the routine monitoring of indicators and automated thresholds for action but rather on the screening of ALL available information to detect any event happening in the community (unusual disease or deaths in humans or animals, unusual or clustering of cases, events/conditions in the community, including environmental conditions).  Intersection of IBS and EBS: All events detected in the EBS system that are investigated and meet the standard case definition should be captured in the IBS system and reported to the next level of health care system. NB: IBS and EBS are complementary sources of information, and both contribute to the early warning function critical for a prompt and proportioned response. The two are not necessarily separate surveillance systems; both are processed through a single activity and some of the surveillance functions might be common to both types. Figure 1: Indicator-based and event-based surveillance for Early Warning Alert and Response System (EWARS) for IDSR Strategy 1.2.3 Event- based surveillance (EBS) and Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) as back-bone to the IDSR Strategy Event-based Surveillance (EBS) and Indicator-Based Surveillance (IBS) are components of Early Warning Alert and Response (EWAR) and epidemic intelligence incorporated in the IDSR strategy. Both EBS and IBS are complimentary with each having a different role to play and purpose. EBS is most likely to pick up alerts to detect small outbreaks early, while IBS is better in monitoring disease trends over time and useful for signalling the start of regular seasonal outbreaks of endemic diseases using alert and epidemic thresholds. IBS may not be useful for smaller events because alerts are either averaged out in large data sets, or lost in smaller data sets. EBS is also better at picking up alerts indicating outbreaks in areas where access to healthcare is limited. In the context of IDSR strategy, the flow of EBS information follows the same reporting lines as IBS i.e. from community to health facility to district and to national level. EBS and IBS are applied at all levels of the health system namely community, health facility, district and national levels (Illustrated in figure 2). Figure 2: Levels of Applications and Reporting of EBS and IBS in the context of IDSR 1.3 Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response strategy Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR) strategy was adopted by WHO AFRO member states in September 1998 as the approach for improving public health surveillance and response for priority diseases, conditions and events at community, health facility, district and national level. IDSR promotes rational and efficient use of resources by integrating and streamlining common surveillance activities and functions. The IDSR strategy makes surveillance and laboratory data more usable, and this helps public health managers and decision-makers improve detection and response to the leading causes of illness, death and disability in African countries including Malawi. As part of improvement of the healthcare system, IDSR strategy also assists countries to better monitor and track planned targets and ensure that they are achieved in a timely manner. Surveillance activities for different diseases involve similar functions (detection, sample collection, reporting, analysis and interpretation, feedback, action) and often use the same structures, processes and personnel. As such, the principles of surveillance are the same whether applied to a single disease, condition or event or multiple diseases. What may differ is whether the target is elimination or eradication, which may require time-limited intensive efforts aimed at proving the absence of disease.  What takes place in an integrated system? All surveillance activities are coordinated and streamlined. Rather than using scarce resources to maintain multiple surveillance systems with separate vertical activities, resources are combined to collect, manage and analyse information at a single focal point at each level. Several activities are combined into one integrated activity, and take advantage of similar surveillance functions, skills, resources and target populations. For example, surveillance activities for Acute Flaccid Paralysis (AFP) often address surveillance for neonatal tetanus, measles and other Vaccine Preventable Diseases (VPDs) or any unusual events. Thus, health workers who routinely visit health facilities to search for AFP cases also review district and health facility records for information about other priority diseases in the area. HSAs interact with their community members on a regular basis and ask about a range of diseases, conditions and events; communities know they can bring anything unusual to the attention of their focal persons, or through their VHCs. The district level is the hub and focus for integrating surveillance functions. The district is the first level in the local health system, which has dedicated staff in all aspects of public health such as planning as well as supporting implementation of Health Sector Strategic Plan (HSSP), monitoring health events in the health facility, and in the community, mobilizing community action, asking for national assistance to protect the district’s health. Similar functions also occur at the various administrative levels. Surveillance focal points at the district and national levels collaborate with emergency response committees at each level to plan relevant public health response actions and actively seek opportunities for combining resources. The focus is on the creation of an overall public health surveillance system with sufficient capacity for detecting, confirming and responding to diseases, conditions and events. IDSR ensures that the information flow is bi-directional (horizontal and vertical), so that each level is informed of potential outbreaks and response interventions in a timely manner.  Integration refers to efficient use of human resource and harmonizing different methods, software, data collection forms, standards and case definitions in order to prevent inconsistent information and maximize efforts among all disease prevention and control programmes and stakeholders. Where possible, a common reporting form, a single data entry system for multiple diseases, and common communication channels are used. Training and supervision are integrated, a common feedback bulletin is used, and other resources such as computers and vehicles are shared. IDSR involves full time coordination of surveillance activities and joint action (planning, implementation, monitoring and evaluation) whenever it is possible and useful.  Coordination refers to working or acting together effectively for the rational and efficient use of available but limited resources such as the Health Management Information System (HMIS) and various disease programs. Coordination involves information sharing, joint planning, monitoring and evaluation in order to provide accurate, consistent and relevant data and information to policy-makers and stakeholders at district, and national levels. To facilitate coordination and collaboration, national and district multi-sectoral, multidisciplinary co-ordination committees are constituted. It is responsible, at that level, for coordination of surveillance activities in close collaboration or synergy with the committee set up for epidemic response (please see Section 5.0 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines) 1.3.1 Objectives of Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response Broad Objective: To improve countries` abilities to detect, investigate, report, confirm, and effectively respond to high-priority communicable, non-communicable diseases and all other public health events The specific objectives of IDSR are to: Strengthen the capacity of countries to conduct effective surveillance activities: train personnel at all levels; develop and carry out plans of action; and advocate and mobilize resources. Increase involvement of clinicians and other cadres of health staff in the surveillance activities  Integrate multiple surveillance systems so that tools, personnel and resources are used more efficiently. Improve the triangulation and use of information to detect changes in trend in order to conduct a rapid response to suspected and confirmed outbreaks; monitor the impact of interventions (for example, declining incidence, spread, and case fatality) and to facilitate evidence-based response to public health events; health policy design; planning; and management Improve the flow of surveillance information between and within levels of the health system using electronic tools. Build strong laboratory systems and networks at national and district levels to confirm pathogens and other hazards, monitor of drug sensitivity and increase efficacy of point-of-care tests (PoC tests) Trigger epidemiological investigations of reported public health problems To strengthen implementation of effective public health interventions.  Mount an effective response to public health emergencies Emphasize community participation in detection, reporting and response to public health problems including case-based and event-based surveillance and response and risk communication in line with International Health Regulations (IHR). 1.4 IDSR and IHR (2005) International Health Regulations (2005) is a binding and legal instrument which urges all State parties to develop minimum core public health capacities.  1.4.1 IHR 2005 purpose and goal The purpose of the IHR 2005 is to prevent, protect against, control and provide public health response to the international spread of disease in ways that are relevant and restricted to public health risks, and which avoid unnecessary interference with international traffic and trade. The scope of IHR has been expanded from three diseases (cholera, plague and yellow fever) to all Public Health Emergencies of International Concern (PHEIC). They include those caused by infectious diseases, chemical agents, radioactive materials and contaminated food. Since the goal of IDSR is to strengthen the overall national system for the surveillance of diseases particularly at the district level and aims to ensure a continuous and timely provision and use of information for public health decision making, IDSR offers to the implementation of IHR 2005 the following: An infrastructure for surveillance, investigation, confirmation, reporting and response  Skilled human resources Defined implementation process (sensitization, assessment, plan of action, implementation, monitoring and evaluation) Generic guides for assessment; Plan of action development; Technical guidelines; training materials; tools and Standard Operating Procedures that incorporate IHR 2005 components. Member States in the African Region have thus recommended that IHR (2005) should be implemented in the context of IDSR. IHR (2005) is therefore not a separate surveillance system but rather requires countries to put in place a “sensitive, reliable and flexible surveillance system that meets international standards”. IDSR is a system with that potential and it will ensure a reliable supply of information to the national level in order to fulfil IHR requirements. The IHR (2005) provides an opportunity to address the threat to international public health security and trade caused by emerging and re-emerging infectious diseases including PHEIC. Moreover, IHR also provide an excellent opportunity to strengthen surveillance and response systems, and to act as a potent driver for IDSR implementation.  IDSR and IHR 2005 share common functions as described in figure 3 below (detection, notification, reporting, verification and confirmation and timely response). ￼ Figure 3: Implementing IHR through IDSR1 1A guide for assessment teams. International Health Regulations (2005): Protocol for assessing national surveillance and response capacities for the International Health Regulations (IHR) in accordance with Annex 1A of the regulations. February 2009 The IHR (2005) guidelines have practical implications for IDSR. In the IHR (2005) guideline, all public health conditions and events of international concern (PHEIC) should be detected, assessed and responded to timely, using an adapted response rather than pre-set measures. The IHR (2005) guidelines also include the measures at points of entry (airports, ports and ground crossing) and containment at source of public health events. IHR (2005) guidelines also includes capturing rumours of “unexplained illness or clusters” as an event category for reporting from lower levels. Because of the major role IHR (2005) plays for timely detection and verification of suspected public health emergencies and events, event-based surveillance is now part of IDSR and the IHR. 1.4.2 Monitoring and evaluating the functional core capacity for implementation of IHR (2005) Following the Ebola outbreak experience in 2015, several IHR 2005 review committees and various expert panels have recommended that, in addition to annual monitoring of IHR, there is a need for additional tools to be used to monitor and evaluate IHR (2005) implementation.  Consequently, since 2016, WHO, member states and partners have adopted the combined approach of the IHR 2005 monitoring and evaluation process. The four components of the IHR (2005) Monitoring and Evaluation Framework include: Mandatory annual reporting to the World Health Assembly (WHA), the State Party Annual Reporting(SPAR) Joint external evaluation (JEE) After Action Review (AAR) and/or Intra Action Review Simulation Exercises((SIMEX)  The four components highlight a more functional approach to assessing IHR (2005) capacities and foster transparency and mutual accountability. This is illustrated in figure 4 below. Figure 4: IHR monitoring and evaluation framework 1.5 One Health and IDSR One Health is an approach to address a shared health threat at the human-animal-environment interface based on collaboration, communication, and coordination across all relevant sectors and disciplines, with the ultimate goal of achieving optimal health outcomes for both people and animals. A One Health approach applies to the local, regional, national, and global levels. Humans and animals (domestic and wildlife) share the same eco-system and the opportunities for spill-over of diseases are increasing with modern trends in globalization, growing population pressures, climate change, economic development, mass urbanization, and increasing demand for animal-sourced foods.   The One Health approach is intrinsic to and strongly reinforced by WHO’s IHR (2005) and the IDSR strategy as well as other global health frameworks. The One Health approach applies toward improving indicator and event-based surveillance, which is cornerstone for the early warning function of the IDSR. Animal and human health workers as well as other relevant partners should be engaged at various levels to be information sources for IDSR to further facilitate information sharing and joint rapid response activities.  The One Health approach offers a comprehensive framework for IHR (2005) implementation, helping to address Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) of all sources. The key principles of the One Health approach include prevention and control of emerging infectious diseases (reference to internationally adopted standards i.e. IHR (2005) and OIE (World Organization for Animal Health) international standards), and support for national public health services and build on the existing structures.   This principle of One Health approach also considers the role of changing environments with regard to infectious and chronic disease risks affecting humans and animals. By utilizing data, expertise and management approaches in the environment, Environmental health practitioners can assist in enhancing the understanding of the root causes of diseases, and better account for complexity of environmental factors.  A strong functional IDSR thus requires improved communication, coordination and collaboration from all sectors for the implementation of an effective One Health framework. Thus the Malawi National Focal Point for IHR (NFP) has incorporated the animal and environmental health sectors to effectively implement IHR (2005) through IDSR in a One Health approach. 1.6 IDSR and Disaster Risk Management (DRM) Disaster is defined as the serious disruption of the functioning of a community or a society, causing widespread human, material, economic or environmental losses exceeding the ability of the affected community or society to cope using its own resources. In 2012, the African region member states, including Malawi, adopted the Disaster Risk Management (DRM): A strategy for the health sector in the African Region, which aims to comprehensively address DRM. Disaster Risk Management (DRM) is defined as the systematic process of using administrative and organizational directives, operational skills and capacities to implement strategies, policies and improved coping capacities in order to lessen the adverse impact of hazards and the possibility of disaster. DRM is driven by conducting Hazard Analysis, followed by the assessment on the level of vulnerability and available coping capacity. The ultimate objective of DRM is reducing risk by reducing vulnerability or improving the capacity to mitigate impact of a hazard. IDSR is an important tool in the DRM, as it provides early warning information, which is crucial for risk assessment and ultimately, risk reduction. IDSR assists in identification of hazards, assessment, risk communication and monitoring of disaster risks, and hence enhance early warning component. 1.7 Implementing Cross Border activities in the context of IDSR  Given the ecological distribution of communicable diseases and the porosity of international borders, it is imperative that countries in the region work together to control and contain them.  The free movement of people and goods across the borders within the region provides opportunities for cross-border spread of diseases. In addition, in the urban centres located at border points a disaster on one side of the border can easily affect the health of a large number of people on both sides of the borders. It is therefore logical that countries in the region engage each other in coordinated and synchronized implementation of interventions so as to control the communicable diseases in the region. Developing cross-border framework will therefore provide an opportunity for countries to initiate and strengthen priority cross-border activities for disease control, including but not limited to disease surveillance, epidemic preparedness and outbreak control as well as building core capacities to ensure compliance to the International Health Regulations (IHR (2005). Malawi has since established cross-border framework with its neighbouring countries Zambia, Mozambique and Tanzania and will work on the following to enhance compliance and build the core capacities Strengthen cross border surveillance and response framework with the neighbouring countries using the existing IDSR systems in the respective countries in collaboration with WHO Establish procedures for data sharing within the framework of IDSR When outbreaks are detected through the IDSR system the neighbouring cross border areas and districts should be notified using the reporting tools of IDSR. If they are reporting a similar outbreak, coordinated response efforts with the IDSR response structures as described in Sections 4, 5 and 6 of the 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines will be done. Ensure cross border (district-district) coordination and collaboration on surveillance issues and provide notification of any outbreaks in the neighbouring district. International or cross-border notification should also be done if needed Develop and organize simulation exercises with cross border district teams Organize regular cross border meetings Engage political leaders to assist districts to facilitate cross border district surveillance and response initiatives  1.8 Electronic IDSR (eIDSR) as a platform to enhance real time surveillance The application of e-tools in the health sector has the potential to provide real-time validated data for public health surveillance, investigation and prompt outbreak response. Electronic IDSR (eIDSR) provides new opportunities for acceleration of the achievement of the IHR (2005) core capacities. Electronic IDSR (eIDSR) is the application of electronic tools to the principles of IDSR to facilitate prevention, prediction, detection, reporting and response. It is based on; Standardised interoperable and interconnected information systems administered within the national context Rapid collection, analysis, reporting and use of disease/events data in real-time for appropriate public health action. While paper-based tools can also provide timely information, Malawi recognises the need and like other countries aims to have electronic tools to facilitate timely transmission of data to enable timely response to public health threats. The implementation of eIDSR in the country aims to;  Fulfil the regional committee recommendations on use of information technology, which is core in the achievement of IHR (2005) requirements by countries Assist in standardization of data Assist in improvement of timeliness and completeness of reporting;  Assist in early detection, investigation, and response to outbreak or public health events  Reduce manual data entry that is prone to errors Ensure systematic information sharing across levels and sectors Enable better data transmission, management including data storage and easy access Enhance virtual, near real-time disease monitoring capability Improve data quality Reduce system costs and easily generate automated alerts Section 9 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines describes in details key guiding principles in establishing eIDSR and the steps Malawi has taken towards achieving this. 1.9 Description of Surveillance functions as described in these guidelines These guidelines assume that all levels of the health system are involved in conducting surveillance activities for detecting and responding to priority diseases, conditions and events (even though the different levels do not perform identical functions). These activities include the following core functions: Step 1 – Identify and record cases, conditions and events: Use of standard case definitions for health service delivery points (human, animal and environment), simplified case definition for community level, in identifying priority diseases, conditions, and identify alerts that can signal emerging public health events. Additionally, case identification can also be done through other health service delivery points (animal and environment) using formal health systems, private health systems or community structures. Case definitions and a functioning alert and verification system are vital for detecting cases and outbreaks. After identification, all alerts including true events must be recorded in a recognized register including the line list register. Step  2 – Report: Suspected cases or conditions or events to the next level for action. If this is an epidemic prone disease or a potential PHEIC, or a disease targeted for elimination or eradication, respond immediately by investigating the case or event, collecting the necessary diagnostic sample and submitting a detailed report. For events to be notified under IHR to WHO, the National Focal Point (NFP) will use the decision instrument (Annex C) to identify any potential PHEIC.  Step  3 –  Analyse (person, place and time) and interpret findings: Surveillance data should be compiled, analysed for trends, compared with data from previous periods and interpreted for use in public health actions.  Step 4 – Investigate and confirm suspected cases, outbreak or event: Case/outbreak confirmation involves the epidemiological investigation of suspected cases and capacity of the laboratory to make confirmation. Take action to ensure that the case and contacts, outbreak or event is investigated and is laboratory confirmed. Capacity for case confirmation is enhanced through improved referral systems, networking and partnerships. Gather evidence about what may have caused the outbreak or event, by including also non-human sources of information e.g. animals (domestic and wildlife), environment, etc. and use it to select appropriate control and prevention strategies. Social, gender and behavioural factors should also be collected and used to tailor locally appropriate responses and risk communication. Step 5 – Prepare: Preparedness refers to the availability of public health emergency preparedness and response plans, including stockpiling (vaccines, drugs and laboratory reagents), designation of isolation facilities, setting aside resources for outbreak response and training of relevant personnel. Take steps in advance of occurrence of outbreaks or public health events, to prepare teams that may respond quickly and set aside essential supplies and equipment which will be available for immediate action. Ensure that a mechanism for coordination of response measures is set even before an outbreak occurs. Establishing pre-positioned ‘outbreak response contracts’ and Memorandum of Understanding (MOUs) between UN agencies and NGOs/civil society helps logistical support to be sent to the lowest level quickly for action. Use historical data from human health and other relevant sectors (such as meteorological, animal, environment, etc.) to assess vulnerabilities and risks to the population. The risk analysis can also be conducted through prediction models.  Step 6 - Respond: When an outbreak, acute public health event or condition is detected, an investigation should take place to determine the cause of the problem, identify gaps and vulnerabilities, coordinate and mobilize resources and personnel to implement the appropriate public health response. The results of the investigation should guide the response. At National level, a Public Health Emergency Operations Centre (PHEOC) should be activated under the leadership of a government official with decision-making authority and at the district level a similar coordination mechanism for response. Identify a spokesperson and ensure a risk communication plan is in place and put a coordination platform for all stakeholders who are involved in communication. Meet with community political and religious leaders and elders to ensure adequate community engagement to get successful responses  Step 7 – Risk communication: Risk communication is an essential element for all surveillance systems, as well as for disaster and emergency preparedness and response.  It is the real-time exchange of information, advice and opinions between experts, community leaders, or officials and the people who are at risk. Encourage future cooperation by communicating with all levels including communities that provided data, reported outbreaks, cases and events, about the investigation outcome and success of response efforts. Acknowledge the reporting by communities. Step 8 – Monitor, evaluate, supervise and provide feedback to improve the surveillance system: Assess the effectiveness of the surveillance and response systems, in terms of timeliness, quality of information, preparedness, (thresholds, case management) and overall performance. Provide feedback to reinforce health workers’ efforts to participate in the surveillance system. Take action to correct problems and make improvements. Different evaluation procedures can be used such as After Action Review (AAR), Intra Action Review (IAR) Joint External Evaluation (JEE), Simulation Exercises (SIMEX), operational review etc. Community representatives, private sector NGOs, bilateral and multi-lateral should be included in these evaluation activities.  1.9.1 The different levels where surveillance activities are performed The levels in Malawi are defined as follows: Community: Represented by basic community-level services such as trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers, village or community leaders (religious, traditional or political) or school teachers, health and agriculture extension workers, locally identified community-based surveillance volunteers, veterinarians, chemical sellers, and traditional healers. Health facility: For surveillance purposes, all institutions (public, private, NGOs or others faith-based organizations) with outpatient and/or in-patient facilities are defined as a “health facility.” Point of Entry; For surveillance purposes, these include all ground crossings, airports and ports implementing public health measures for incoming and outgoing travellers. Reports to district level but also has the mandate to notify the national level. District: Secondary level of health service delivery that implements policies made at national level. This level reports to the national level. National level: This is the central level where policies are set and resources are allocated. In relation to surveillance, this level reports on priority diseases and uses the IHR decision instrument in Section 2 to report public health events of international concern to WHO. In an integrated system, some laboratory services are available at each level described above. A description of laboratory functions by level is in Section 1.0. These guidelines focus on improving surveillance for all service delivery points (public and private).  1.9.2 How districts can strengthen surveillance and response Surveillance systems can be assessed using the standard protocol for evaluating the surveillance system developed by WHO-AFRO (Protocol for the Assessment of National Communicable Disease Surveillance and Response Systems WHO/CDS/CSR/ISR/2001.2).  Districts can also use a matrix of IDSR functions and skills to describe their role in the surveillance system. Such a matrix describes a complete system in which all the skills and activities are in place. Each level supports activities at other levels and reinforces the opportunity for successful decision-making at corresponding levels and functions. In an IDSR system under development, the matrix provides a systematic framework for improving and strengthening the system. Practical uses of the IDSR matrix include: Ensuring that all necessary functions and capacities have been identified Establishing accountability to provide a basis for assigning functions to appropriate  levels and determining what capacities should be present Organizing activities and training for human resource development Managing, monitoring and evaluating programs Strengthening district laboratory capacity, including laboratory information system Planning for resources (human, material/supplies and financial). Moreover, the IDSR matrix also illustrates several key assumptions that need to occur for the core functions of the surveillance system. If one or more of the elements at each level is not present or is being performed poorly, the risk of failure for achieving surveillance and control objectives increases. An effective system will be supported at each level from the levels above and below. A complete system minimizes any delay in taking public health actions. The functions of detection, reporting, analysis, investigation, response, risk communication, monitoring and evaluation and providing feedback are interdependent and should always be linked. The IDSR matrix in Annex A, defines the surveillance functions and how they are achieved at each level of the health system including the role of WHO in relation to IDSR core functions. 1.10 Efforts of the WHO in the African Region to strengthen IDSR WHO-AFRO provides technical support for implementation of surveillance and response at every level of the health system, including: The development of comprehensive technical guidelines for each level A protocol for adapting guidelines to each level within each country Training of human resources involved in surveillance and response system Advocacy for resources and resource mobilization Coordinating the monitoring, detection and control of diseases, conditions and events, epidemics and public health emergencies across countries. Sharing public health information and promoting documentation of best practices 1.11 The contents of the guidelines The previous edition of these guidelines have been revised in order to incorporate lessons learnt from previous epidemics, new frameworks or strategies such the regional strategy for health security and emergencies, the revised IHR monitoring and evaluation framework, the initiatives for enhancing prevention, detection and response to public health events (Global Health Security Agenda, One Health, DRM), key regional strategies and rising non-communicable disease threats and road traffic injuries in the context development of resilient health systems. The revised guidelines also aim to address how to implement the IHR (2005) requirements and capacities for surveillance and response. These guidelines have been adapted to reflect Malawi’s national priorities, policies and public health structures; and will be used in conjunction with other similar guidelines/strategies or initiatives. Overall, the revised guidelines will incorporate the following:  Strengthening indicator based surveillance with better analysis, reporting and use of routine data for decision making Strengthening Event Based Surveillance Improving community based surveillance Improving Cross Border Surveillance and response Scaling up e-IDSR implementation Improving reporting and information sharing platforms Improving data sharing between sectors Tailoring IDSR to Emergency or Fragile Health System contexts   The guidelines are intended for use as: A general reference for surveillance activities across all levels A set of definitions for thresholds that trigger some action for responding to specific diseases or conditions A stand-alone reference for level-specific guidelines A resource for developing training, supervision and evaluation of surveillance activities A guide for improving early detection and preparedness for outbreak response. 1.11.1 Key people and entities that will use this guideline These guidelines are to be used by health care workers at Primary Health Care (PHC) levels both public and private because the PHC level is where illness is presented for the first time.  Additionally, these guidelines will be used by; Disease surveillance managers and officers at all levels IHR National Focal Points IHR District Focal Points Health Authority at Point of Entry (PoE) Clinicians Infection Prevention and Control officers National laboratory directorates  Veterinary and wildlife officers Environmental health officers  District Health Management Teams Hospital management teams Public Health Officers Epidemiologists Medical Doctors  Nurses Pharmacists Health facility managers Medical and nursing educators Health Promotion Officers Logisticians Laboratory personnel Community leaders, Ward Councillors and District political officials Other public health experts and practitioners in specialised institutions Public Health Training Institutions Other health partners including NGOs Other line Ministries 1.12 Priority diseases, conditions and events included in the IDSR Malawi has selected the following communicable and non-communicable diseases and conditions or events as priorities for integrated disease surveillance in the country. (see Table 1 for the priority diseases, conditions and events). The diseases or conditions are recommended because they are: Required internationally under IHR (for example, smallpox, poliomyelitis due to wild-type poliovirus, human influenza caused by a new subtype, SARS); Diseases with highly epidemic potential to cause serious public health impact due to their ability to spread rapidly internationally (for example, cholera, plague, yellow fever, viral haemorrhagic fever); Principal causes of morbidity and mortality due to communicable diseases and conditions in the African Region (for example, malaria, pneumonia, diarrhoeal diseases, tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS, maternal deaths and injuries) Priority Non-communicable diseases or conditions in the region (high blood pressure, diabetes mellitus, mental health and malnutrition) Effective control and prevention interventions are available for addressing the public health problems they pose (for example onchocerciasis, trypanosomiasis); Intervention programs supported by WHO for prevention and control, eradication or elimination of the diseases exist. For example, the Expanded Program on Immunizations (EPI), the Integrated Management of Neonatal and Childhood Illness (IMNCI). These IDSR priority diseases, conditions and events require special reporting requirements which are different from other routine reporting mechanisms for other diseases. Section 2 (Reporting priority diseases, conditions and events), will describe more on how to report priority diseases and conditions. The list of priority diseases for Malawi is based on the local epidemiological situation, needs, health system and resources available. The list of priority public health events to be reported by health facilities has been established by a group of relevant stakeholders from and related to the National Health Surveillance System. Table 1 below shows the priority list of diseases and conditions under IDSR.

In IDSR, all levels of the health system are involved in surveillance activities for responding to priority diseases and conditions. The sections in the guidelines are organized according to these core activities:  Section 1:  Identify and record cases of priority diseases, conditions and events  Section 2: Report priority diseases, conditions and events  Section 3: Analyse and interpret data Section 4:  Investigate suspected outbreaks, and other public health events  Section 5: Prepare to respond to outbreaks and other public health events  Section 6: Respond to outbreaks and public health events  Section 7: Risk communication\\t Section 8: Monitor, evaluate, supervise and provide feedback to improve surveillance and response  Section 9: Electronic Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (eIDSR) Section 10: Tailoring IDSR to Emergency or Fragile Health System contexts Section 11: Summary guidelines for specific priority diseases and conditions The various sections of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines have been put into six (6) separate booklets in the following order: Booklet one: Introduction Section Booklet two: Sections 1, 2 and 3 Booklet three: Sections 4, 5, 6 and 7 Booklet four: Sections 8 and 9 Booklet five: Sections 10 Booklet six: Section 11 Each section has annexes which reference key functions highlighted in the guidelines. Each section is relevant for all levels of the health system and provides the perspective of how the country can carry out each function to attain required level of surveillance and response. Furthermore, a section on eIDSR has been included which summarizes the steps and processes Malawi is taking to establish a fully functional eIDSR system. 1.14 Annexes for Introduction section Annex A:\\tIDSR matrix: Core functions and activities by health system levels Annex B:\\tTool for assessment of surveillance and response at the district level.

used an assessment tool developed by WHO/AFRO to assess their national surveillance, epidemic preparedness and response systems and to identify where improvements are needed. Others have used newly developed tools such as the JEE as a means of assessing country capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health events. The assessment provides results that can be used to solve problems with resources, the quality and timeliness of surveillance data, and how the information is used. The national strategic plan could also be used as reference while preparing a district specific action plan. For other countries, who have undergone JEE, the NAPHS (National Action Plan for Health Security) can also be used. IDSR is not proposing establishment of a new system, but is providing guidance on how to prepare to conduct surveillance and response activities. However, if the district has the resources and skills to conduct an assessment to document the situation of surveillance and response activities within the district or wishes to update the district profile, then they may use the checklist below after adapting it to the local context. This tool could help to identify where districts can identify activities to improve their performance and capacity for disease surveillance and response. Case and event identification: Determine availability and knowledge of standard case definitions for reporting suspected priority diseases and conditions including events of public health concern. Define the sources of information about health events in the district, including points of contact the community has with health services. For example, list the following sources on a list of district reporting sites Health facilities and hospitals Laboratories (including non-public ones: private for profit, military, NGOs, faith-based) Point of Entry Community health workers (including Animal Health Surveillance Assistants) VHCs or focal points (e.g. shopkeepers, market women, barbers, farmers, etc.) Birth attendants Traditional healers Rural community leaders who have knowledge of health events in the community (for example, the village elders, traditional healer, school teachers, leaders of faith-based communities, etc.) Public health officers Private sector practitioners Public safety officers such as fire, rescue or police departments Animal health and veterinary structures and services Industry, food safety and environmental health laboratories Mass media, web sites and health news search applications Others including NGOs It is important to also have and maintain a logbook of rumours to report events and feedback loop to confirm or dispel rumours. Identify surveillance focal points for each source of information.  Identify and specify   opportunities for community involvement in surveillance of health events. Reporting Specify the priority events, diseases and conditions for surveillance within the district and those directed by national policy. List diseases that are: Epidemic-prone or events which require immediate reporting e.g. unexplained cluster of illness or deaths Diseases targeted for eradication and elimination Other diseases of public health importance including non-communicable diseases For each priority event, disease or condition, review the minimum data elements that health facilities and other sources should report. State when they should be reported, to whom and how. State the information that should be reported from in-patient sources and outpatient sources. For example, a minimum requirement would be to report all cases and deaths for the selected diseases and conditions State the diseases or conditions that require immediate reporting and communicate the list to health facilities in the district. Define the means for reporting data to the district (by phone, by form, by voice). If there is electronic reporting, do all facilities have access to computers and modems? Specify how electronic reporting should be done and if paper forms will be used to collect data, how transcription will occur from paper to electronic form. Define how often the required data should be reported. Define a feedback mechanism from district to higher levels (national) Define the data management tools available in the district and how they should be used in an integrated system. Define how frequently the tools should be used for reporting diseases, conditions or events. Case-based surveillance reporting forms Diagnostic (if point of care is used) and lab-specimen-based surveillance reporting forms Specimen tracking forms/logbooks (within the laboratory) and also forms/logbook for referral of specimens Line lists for use in outbreaks while also ensuring comprehensive capture of variable from other non-human sectors Contact tracing forms Tables for recording summary totals Routine weekly reporting forms Routine monthly reporting forms Routine quarterly reporting forms Graphs for time analysis of data Maps for place analysis of data Charts for data analysis by person Periodically update the availability of relevant supplies at each reporting site for  conducting surveillance. (Note: If a reporting site has the capacity for electronic reporting, there should be an electronic format that is compatible with the methods used at the district, region and national levels. In most countries, where there is eIDSR, DHIS2 has frequently been used as a data system. If electronic reporting is NOT available, ensure that the focal points who are required to manage data have a reliable supply of data collection forms, paper, coloured pencils, graph paper, and log books).  Define mechanism to ensure data is collected as per given timelines, and put mechanism for accountability if reports are not submitted on time. Data analysis Define the data management requirement for each reporting site. For example, develop and disseminate the procedures including deadlines so that reporting sites know that they must report for each reporting period (e.g., month). Tally, compile and report summary totals Periodically check data quality and eventually clean them Analyse data: produce weekly/monthly/Quarterly/Annual summaries in tables, graphs or maps Provide some interpretation to the next higher level. Submit data to the next level (SMS, e-mail, fax/case-based forms, and line-list). File and secure back-up copies of the data Provide feedback and recommendations to the community health workers, all relevant Reporting Sites, community leaders and track implementation of recommendations. Decide if current forms address the priorities of integrated disease surveillance and response. For example, if current forms provide the information necessary for detecting problems and signalling a response to the priority integrated disease surveillance diseases Gather and present relevant data about your district that can be used to advocate for additional resources for improving surveillance and response activities. (Example: Health workers are able to document an increase in malaria cases; they know that an effective response is available with insecticide-treated bed nets. The IDSR officer use data to show the expected reduction in malaria cases if some of the community’s bed net cost could be supported by local businesses). Investigation and confirmation of suspected cases, outbreaks or events: Describe the laboratory and diagnostic referral network for confirming priority diseases and conditions in the district. For example, list the following: a. Public, private or NGO district facilities which have Point of Care (PoC) diagnostics or use Rapid Diagnostic Tests (RDT) laboratory services  b. Public, private or NGO district facilities with reliable laboratory services for confirming priority diseases. c. Prevention, control or special surveillance activities in the district with laboratory access (for example, any HIV sentinel surveillance sites in the district). Describe the methods or mechanism for active case search and where appropriate the procedures for searching for contacts Preparation for response to outbreaks and other public health events Update the policies of the district rapid response team so that assessing preparedness is a routine agenda item of the team. Refer to Section 4 of these 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines for composition of the PHERRT.  Identify a coordination mechanism which will oversee the meetings for preparedness and response. Refer to section 5 on how to formulate a coordination mechanism and the composition of the team, which will lead response and planning process for meetings. Specify and disseminate schedules for: Meeting to routinely assess preparedness for public response and discuss current problems or activities. Put mechanisms like reminders to ensure that meetings are done as planned Meetings to discuss Outbreak response including reviewing key recommendations and actions and status of implementation For each priority event, disease or condition selected, state the available public response activity and develop a contingency plan for the particular priority event, disease or condition. Identify activities and interventions which the district can do, and which help from outside is needed. Refer to section 4, 5, 6 and 9 for standard key elements that are needed in the preparedness and response activities  For each disease or condition that the district can respond to, specify the target, alert threshold or analyse results that would trigger an action Communication and Feedback Define methods for informing and supporting health workers in the implementation of integrated disease surveillance. For example; List the current opportunities for training health workers in surveillance, response or data management in the district. Coordinate training opportunities between disease programs that take advantage of overlapping skills between programs such as supervision, report writing, budgeting, data analysis, and using data to set priorities. Define the training needs for each category of health workers based on supervision or during response to a particular event. Decide whether this will be an initial training in surveillance and response skills or a refresher training on how to integrate surveillance activities. Establish indicators of quality (management) performance of health workers and regularly assess the performance of health workers. Describe how communication about surveillance and response takes place between the district and the surveillance focal points and other focal points from Animal sectors and other key relevant sectors. Clarify who is responsible for reporting at each level periodically. Include methods such as monthly meetings, newsletters, telephone calls and so on.  Review and update feedback procedures and methods between the district, health facilities and community as well as between the district and higher levels. Specify the feedback methods and update as necessary: Bulletins summarizing data reported by health facilities to the district Periodic meetings to discuss public health problems and recent activities Supervisory visits Outline the communication mechanism available including protocols and guidelines for risk communication. Identify a spokesperson and ensure training has been done on required protocols. Develop a mechanism of linkage between the community and health facilities with the Public Health Epidemic Management Committee that can be activated during an outbreak and for routine activities. Refer to section 6 and 7 of the 3rd Edition Malawi IDSR Technical Guidelines on the key elements for risk communication before, during outbreak and after the outbreak. Evaluation and improvement of the surveillance system Decide if additional indicators will be evaluated and plan how to monitor and   evaluate timeliness and completeness of reporting. State three or more objectives you would like to achieve for improving surveillance in your district over the next year based on evidence. Annex C:  IHR 2005 Decision Instrument￼￼ Annex D: Events of potential international health concern requiring reporting to WHO under the International Health Regulations 2005 Surveillance on specific risks The control or containment of known risks to public health is one of the most powerful ways to improve international public health security. The threat posed by known risks constitutes the vast majority of events with a potential to cause public health emergencies that fall within the scope of the International Health Regulations (2005). There are already existing control programmes which address infectious diseases as well as food and environmental safety and contribute significantly to WHO global alert and response system. The environmental hazards include but are not limited to: Chemical Food Ionizing radiation Non-ionizing radiation Technical information on these risks can be obtained from various sources (See the references at the end).  Areas of interest for the purpose of capacity building of integrated surveillance should include partnerships to address the following: 1. Environmental health emergencies like: Natural events Technological Incidents Complex emergencies Deliberate events 2. Chemical risks in food: Acute and Chronic dietary exposure (environmental or intentional pollution) 3. Zoonosis: Emerging zoonosis Neglected zoonosis Topics for surveillance on specific risks Infectious disease hazards New, known and unknown infectious disease threats. Zoonotic disease events Using a One Health approach is critical to link human health to animal health at the human-animal-environment interface. Coordinating, collaborating, and communicating across sectors and One Health partners allows us to maximize resources while achieving optimal health for people and animals living in a shared environment. Detecting diseases that affect animals is important as they may pose a risk to human health and could save lives.  Food safety events Food and waterborne diarrhoeal diseases are leading causes of illness and death in less developed countries, killing approximately 1.8 million people annually, most of whom are children. The identification of the source of an outbreak and its containment are critical to the IHR. Chemical events The detection and control of chemical, toxic and environmentally-induced events are critical for the implementation of the IHR. Radiological and nuclear events A radio-nuclear emergency at a nuclear facility may be caused by accidental spills or the result of a deliberate act. It may also be detected as the result of clinical examination, when patients with radiation injuries are admitted to health care facility, while the source of exposure may not yet be confirmed.

International Health Regulations (2005): Protocol for assessing national surveillance and response capacities for the International Health Regulations (IHR) in accordance with Annex 1A of the regulations. February 2009. Annex E: Guide for Establishing Community Based Surveillance and response Community-Based Surveillance (CBS) is a simple, adaptable and low-cost public health initiative managed by communities in coordination with the formal surveillance structures. Communities and designated community focal points are trained and empowered to be aware of potential health risks including emerging events that might indicate a new health risk, close monitoring for notifiable and seasonal diseases or signs of an existing disease outbreak. An event that appears ‘unusual’ to the community might be to a health-trained professional an early warning sign of a more serious and larger health risk or public health event. Two different strategies of community-based surveillance can be used to collect community information; Community Event-Based Surveillance (CEBS)  CEBS relies on reporting of unusual events and this is designed to rapidly identify whether something might be wrong in the community. Information may be incomplete, unconfirmed and may even be a rumour. The definition of an ‘unusual event’ will change from one community to another, and needs to be defined in each context. It can be one event, or a cluster of events, that may be unusual for a specific community or during a certain time of year. For example, an unusual event could be: “A cluster of deaths from an unknown cause in the same household or adjacent households” Community-Indicator Based Surveillance (CIBS). This type of surveillance is used to identify/ report events based on agreed indicators (case definitions). Information from community can come from people who have already been oriented on the indicators and these include community volunteers, or any other representatives from community. CIBS relies on reporting a suspected case or the trend of a specific disease(s) using a community case definition. A community case definition is two or three easily identified symptoms associated with a specific disease. It is a more basic form of syndromic (symptom) reporting that is used by health professional in national/IDSR and other disease surveillance systems. Examples include- Influenza (flu) community case definition: “sudden illness, fever, cough and difficulty breathing or new, floppy paralysis for AFP. Both systems should be established to ensure all information from the community is captured and quickly reported to a designated surveillance focal person at the next level for follow up. Moreover, these two elements of surveillance should be integrated at the community level. Steps for establishing Community Based Surveillance (CBS)  A crucial step in establishing the Community Based Surveillance is to ensure there is a buy in of both the national and subnational level authorities. This will enable the CBS system to be recognized formally as part of the National Surveillance System and designated people will then be appointed. A designated health facility manager or surveillance officer responsible for coordinating CBS activities should therefore:  Determine within the facility the availability and knowledge of standard community case definitions for reporting suspected priority diseases and conditions and events of public health concern.  Sensitize community leaders, elders and other influencers about the need for CBS, what information is needed, how the information will be used, the process that is being proposed, the characteristics of a successful VHCs, the financial or human resource support being offered by the district and what the community gains by participating. Define the sources of information about health events in the community, including points of contact that the community has with health services. A key informant selected from these sources can form community networks that support the VHCs in early detection of alerts; for example, sensitizing the women and men that often visit the grain milling or tea drinking places. The sources of information include: Home Visits: whereby VHCs are expected to visit all homes in their catchment area regularly to inquire about the priority diseases, any deaths that might have occurred since last visit to the home. Gathering Places: Another way to pick up information on priority events will be for Community health workers to frequently go to village gathering/meeting places. This will not serve as a substitute to the home visits, but rather another approach to ensure that all priority events are identified in good time. Gathering of meeting places in the community are those places where people gather to talk and share news by word-of-mouth. Examples include Community wells, pumps or rivers. In some communities, women gather every day at wells, pumps or rivers to collect drinking water or to wash clothes. While they work, women exchange news about their families and neighbourhood.  Grain milling or grain pounding places: In some communities, women gather every day in the same place to mill, grind or pound grains into flour. Women often exchange news about their families and the neighbourhood as they work.  Bottle stores or tea drinking places: In some communities, men gather every day in the same places to drink and socialize. These places may be ― bottle shops or other drinking places, in someone’s home or shop, or in the shade under a special tree. As they drink, the men sometimes tell each other the news about their families, friends and neighbours.  At the market: A lot of information and news is exchanged at the market. When people go there, they spend some of their time buying or selling things and the rest of their time talking to friends, and neighbours.  At churches, mosques or temples: Sometimes religious leaders make announcements before or after the service to let people know about things that are happening in the neighbourhood. Also, people who attend church or mosque often talk together before or after the service to exchange news about their families, friends and neighbours.  At the home of the village chief or the place where the village elders meet: The village chief and elders are usually kept informed about things that happen in their community. They often gather to talk about community news or to discuss problems and make decisions.  At schools and in school yards: Teachers and pupils often share information and news about their families and friends when they see each other at school or when they play in the school yard. Identify Community key informants (CHW) for each source of information in collaboration with the community. Identify and specify the opportunities for community involvement in surveillance of health events and the role of the VHCs. the volunteers should be people who are trusted by the community, committed to ‘zero-case’ reporting, and they should be reassured that reporting bad news won’t get them into trouble, hence no need to falsify data  Specify the alerts, events, diseases and conditions for surveillance within the catchment area and those directed by national policy and specify the trigger mechanisms.  Compile a list of: epidemic-prone diseases; diseases targeted for eradication and elimination; other diseases of public health importance including non-communicable diseases.  Define methods for informing and supporting focal points in the implementation of CBS e.g. monthly meeting, telephones. List the current opportunities for training focal persons in surveillance and response;  Define the training needs. Develop and pre-test picture based/simplified training material development for non-literate/semi-literate populations for surveillance and reporting; develop picture and game-based based job aids and illustrative daily/weekly schedules.  Train VHCs in surveillance and response skills as well as improved Interpersonal skills, using interactive training, adult learning techniques and role playing. Use of cell-phone based opportunities to play MP3s or other video clips can be helpful during training and in the community.  Describe how communication about surveillance and response takes place and will be tracked between the health facility IDSR focal person and the VHCs. For literate VHCs, design simple alert forms (See Annex 2C) and show them how to fill information and those who are non-literate develop mechanisms of capturing information of events from them. Think of mechanisms like identifying someone from the family member who can assist with actual writing. Include methods such as monthly meetings, telephone calls and so on to ensure tracking of VHCs.  Review and update procedures and methods of supportive supervision and feedback between the health facility and the community health workers and community key informants. Regular refresher trainings should also occur to ensure that community health workers and community key informants understand what and how alerts should be reported. Describe the communication links between the community health workers and community key informants and health facilities with the epidemic management committee that can be activated during an outbreak and for routine activities. Develop general, pictorial, social mobilization materials for community, youth-based or school based awareness. Conduct periodic meetings between the health facility surveillance focal points, VHCs and community leaders to discuss progress, issues, concerns and provide 2-way feedback  State three or more objectives you would like to achieve for improving surveillance in your community over the next year. Formalized CBS framework  CBS should be implemented in a formalized framework where participants are well versed in what constitutes an unusual type of event (an alert) to report (e.g. unexplained cluster of similar severe illnesses within one week, high absenteeism at school) and how and when to report (e.g. through messages or calls from mobile phones). The framework should be supported by a trained facility or dedicated district staff and should be regularly evaluated.  Community representatives that can be members of CBS team  Any community member acceptable by the community can be VHC. They should be selected by the communities they live in so as to increase empowerment and ownership of CBS. Representation could be from basic village-level services such as community health volunteers, community health workers, trained birth attendants, community or village health agents, or similar care providers, village leaders (religious, traditional or political), school teachers, veterinarians, health extension workers, chemical sellers, and traditional healers and in other communities, a respected non-health person such as the barber, shop keeper or  who regularly talks to community members are effective focal points.   Once selected, the VHCs should receive training and carry out their role on how to recognize certain diseases or health conditions for the purpose of reporting suspect cases.  CBS Supervision  The goal of supervision is to improve timeliness of reporting, fine-tune understanding of case definitions, and improve interpersonal communication skills. It is important that supervision is done with evidenced-based approaches so as to know what to improve in the surveillance.  All activities for implementation by CBS should be coordinated by a surveillance officer or health facility manager in his or her locality. He or she will:  prepare a list of priority diseases, event or conditions for inclusion in the CBS based on the adapted IDSR technical guidelines;  share as appropriate a list of simplified community case definitions to facilitate case detection, event detection and monitoring;  develop, test and provide pictorial-based training material and job aids;  develop an interactive training module. build capacity of VHCs in all aspects of surveillance and response;  regularly strengthen the skills and practices of focal points in all appropriate aspects of surveillance and investigation particularly the handling and dissemination of data;  establish feedback loops, which is a critical action for ensuring that CBS continues to work. Ensure that constructive feedback and supportive supervision is done where they are credited and praised for the good job done and pinpoint areas for improvement. disseminate simplified case definitions and alerts using posters or any other latest intervention methods (banners, leaflets, etc. that have been shown to work in that area) to relevant places within the community, as appropriate;  monitor surveillance and response activities, including timeliness and completeness of reporting;  supervise activities of the VHCs including the fine tune understanding of the case definitions. In case, VHCs are used for contact tracing, ensure the facility based person leads the process in collaboration with the health facility based person.  identify and map key health determinants in the area;  provide regular and timely feedback to CBS teams and ensure a two-way process for feedback to build trust between the CBS and the health facility person. NB: In some countries, VHCs may be many in numbers and coordination might pose a challenge. A district may then appoint a CBS Focal Supervisor in a particular community (she/he might be among the CBS FPs) to oversee a specific a number of VHCs. Clear roles of the Community supervisor should be well stipulated so that they should not be the ones deciding if something is a health risk based only on notification Sources of information for CBS A functioning CBS should establish relationships with key sources of information. This includes but is not limited to the following sources of information:  All community based health workers, VHCs, including traditional birth attendants, school teachers, pharmacists, who have trusted relationships with the local community. They are often located in remote areas where access to primary health care is scarce. Families often share information with a trusted, known health worker. Community, traditional, youth or religious leaders and civil society: these individuals and groups may provide informal reports of unusual health events or health risks that they witness in their communities.  Media: local, national and international media are important sources of information for CBS. Events such as clusters of human cases, outbreaks or unexpected and unusual deaths may be covered by local newspapers (printed or available through the Internet) or radio reports before they are detected and reported by local health services.  Traditional medicine practitioners and healers and shrine keepers. In some African countries, a large number of the population depends on traditional medicine for primary health care. Traditional medicine has been used for thousands of years, and these practitioners may constitute a valuable source of information. Families with sick members often seek spiritual guidance at shrines known for healing.  Alternative medicine (herbalists, for example) complementary medicine and non-conventional medicine: these include health care practices that are not integrated into the dominant health care system. Reporting Structure for community alert and verification ￼ N B: Additional reference materials for Community Based Surveillance can be found in the Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response in the African Region: WHO Guide for establishing Community -Based Surveillance and Response Program (August 2014) and IFRC: Community-Based Surveillance: guiding principles March 2017 Annex F: Required surveillance and response core capacities as described in the IHR According to IHR, member states shall use existing national structures and resources to meet their core capacity requirements. These requirements include capacity for surveillance, reporting, notification, verification, response and collaboration activities. Each part is expected to assess the ability of existing national structures and resource to meet the minimum requirements. Based on the results of the assessment, each member state should develop and implement action plan to ensure that these core capacities are present and functioning throughout the country. Annex 1 Part A of the IHR (2005) defines the core capacity requirements for surveillance and response. The regulations recognise the following three levels of the health care system. Community or primary public health response level Intermediate public health response levels National level Local community or primary public health level response At the local community level and/or primary public health response level, the capacities are: To detect events involving disease or death above expected levels for the particular time and place in all areas within the country To report all available essential information immediately to the appropriate level of healthcare response (within 24 hours). At the community level, VHC shall report to the appropriate health facility in the respective catchment area. At the primary public health response level, reporting shall be to the intermediate or national response level, depending on organizational structures. For the purposes of these guidelines, essential information includes the following: Clinical descriptions of cases Laboratory results Sources and type of risk Numbers of human cases and deaths Conditions affecting the spread of the disease and these may include environmental issues like Water and Sanitation, travel history of self and neighbours, behaviour issues like burial practices, distance to health facility/care seeking efforts before detected, weather and accessibility, floods, insecurity, migrant/IDP/refugee population. The public health measures employed and these might include any bylaws which have been instituted; implementation of hygiene measures etc. Intermediate public health response levels The intermediate public health level response core capacities requirement will need to be adapted to the context of each county. Many countries have more than one intermediate level (sub district; district/county and province/region/state) while other smaller countries may have only one level (district or county level). The core capacity requirements and functions of the health system may differ from country to country. For example, while in countries with large federal states the functions of intermediate levels may be close to the core capacity requirements described under “National level”, in smaller states with only one level, the functions of the intermediate level may be close to the community level and/ or primary public health response level. The core capacity requirements at intermediate levels are the following. to confirm the status of reported events and to support or implement additional control measures; and to assess reported events immediately and, if found urgent, to report all essential information to the national level within 24 - 48 hours. For the purposes of this Annex, the criteria for urgent events include serious public health impact and/or unusual or unexpected nature with high potential for spread National Level: Assessment and notification The response at national level consists of two functions - assessment and notification: Coordinate  with World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE) Focal person and the  International Food Safety Authorities Network\\xa0 (INFOSAN) focal person and other sectors to ensure coordination  in assessment and notification of events  Assessment of all reports of urgent events within 48 hours; and Notification to WHO immediately through the IDSR focal person/National IHR Focal Point when the assessment indicates the event is notifiable under paragraph 1 of Article 6 of IHR and the decision instrument for the assessment and notification of events that may constitute a PHEIC in IHR and to inform WHO as required pursuant to Article 7 and paragraph 2 of Article 9 of these Regulations. At the national level, the public health response requires the capacity to: Coordinate public health response by establishing a coordination mechanism which can include setting up of the Public Health Emergency Operation Centre (PHEOC) or a similar coordination structure, and the activation of Incident Management System (See section 5 and 6 for more details) determine rapidly the control measures required to prevent domestic and international spread; provide support through specialized staff, laboratory analysis of samples (domestically or through collaborating centres) and logistical assistance (e.g. equipment, supplies and transport); provide on-site assistance as required to supplement local investigations; provide a direct operational link with senior health and other officials to approve rapidly and implement containment and control measures; provide direct liaison with other relevant government ministries; provide, by the most efficient means of communication available, links with hospitals, clinics, airports, ports, ground crossings, laboratories and other key operational areas for the dissemination of information and recommendations received from WHO regarding events in the State Party’s own territory and in the territories of other States Parties; establish, operate and maintain a national public health emergency response plan, including the creation of a One Health team to respond to events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern; and provide the foregoing on a 24-hour basis. During several consultations at global level the core capacities were summarized into eight components: legislation; policy and coordination; surveillance; preparedness; response; risk communications; laboratory; and human resources. These eight components are all important for IDSR as well.

It calls for strengthening of national capacity for surveillance and control, including sites such as PoE prevention, alert and response to international public health emergencies; global partnerships and international collaboration. In addition to the IHR, it is essential that border health activities be sustainable and align with other surveillance activities under IDSR.  A system to detect, report, and appropriately respond to ill travellers is appropriate. The long-term strategy is to work towards full compliance with IHR at official PoEs, while ensuring that the PoE have also contingency plans.  All designated PoE must have routine capacities established for surveillance and response as well as for effective Public Health Response.  Key Partners:  MoH, Local Government, Airline and Maritime Authorities, Port authorities, Ministries responsible for communication or infrastructures, Ministry of Homeland Security, Ministry of Defence, WHO, IOM, CDC and other key partners as appropriate.  Key Areas for Surveillance and Response at Points of Entry:  Routine measures should be in place at points of entry for the detection of ill travellers; reporting to health authorities; rapid public health assessment; and access to healthcare for severely ill travellers or those whose symptoms suggest a risk to public health, including safe transportation from the point of entry to a health facility.  Detection of ill travellers should include, at a minimum, the following:  Reporting of ill travellers or deaths on board in international aircraft, ships or ground crossings points who arrive at PoE stipulated by various guidelines  Port Health officers and /or immigration officers who are present at select points of entry should be trained to recognize ill travellers they encounter during their routine assessments as well as to conduct an initial assessment of whether the illness poses a potential public health risk. Institution of initial response to an ill traveller if detected at a point of entry should include, at a minimum, the following:  The ability to rapidly isolate the ill traveller from others to avoid potential spread of disease. Availability of a standby Health Teams either in person or remotely by telephone, to conduct a rapid assessment of ill travellers detected at points of entry to determine if a communicable disease of public health concern is suspected.  A health facility located close to the PoE should be designated to provide medical care as needed to severely ill travellers or those with a suspected communicable disease of public health concern. The designated facility should have adequate IPC capacity to prevent spread of disease to staff or other patients and diagnostic capacity including access to laboratory diagnostics.  Ambulance service or other safe transportation should be available to facilitate transport of ill travellers from the point of entry to the designated healthcare facility.  As needed, during a declared public health emergency affecting international travellers or with the potential for international spread of disease, there should also be capacity to implement at short notice, traveller screening or other border health measures as recommended by the WHO.  Role of Competent Authorities:  Competent authorities at designated Point of Entry shall: Report immediately to the next higher level, of all events and diseases with epidemic potential detected at Points of Entry, Notification should also be done at the same time at the National Level, with a provision of copy of the report for the National IHR Focal Point to assess using the decision algorithm. If Yellow fever is being suspected, include yellow fever vaccination for those cases originating from endemic or risk areas  If a traveller is a suspect case, immediately fill alert notification form. Ensure that the traveller/suspect case is kept separate from others including family members. Ensure that the suspected case is transferred to the nearest holding room  Be responsible to ensure that if a suspected traveller is recognized and may not be symptomatic at the time of travel, to take appropriate details and transfer that information to the nearby health facility for close monitoring. The health facility will liaise with the community focal point for close follow-up Be responsible for monitoring baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, postal parcels and human remains departing and arriving from affected areas, so that they are maintained in such a condition that they are free of sources of infection or contamination, including vectors and reservoirs;  Ensure, as far as practicable, that facilities used by travellers at Points of Entry are maintained in a sanitary condition and are kept free of sources of infection or contamination, including vectors and reservoirs;  Be responsible for the supervision of any de-ratting, disinfection, disinfection or decontamination of baggage, cargo, containers, conveyances, goods, postal parcels and human remains or sanitary measures for persons, as appropriate under these Regulations;  Advise conveyance operators, as far in advance as possible, of their intent to apply control measures to a conveyance, and shall provide, where available, written information concerning the methods to be employed.  Report suspected cases to the health facility as soon as possible to organize transport.  Ensure that all competed forms are stored in a proper way. Create a database for events, if a computer is available. Keep a record for register for all events  During an emergency or outbreak response, cross-border coordination should include:  Partners meeting as soon as the epidemic or event is recognized  Assessing the need for, and request support from, the  national Rapid Response Teams when necessary  Meeting regularly to assess the status of the outbreak or epidemic as indicated  Regularly sharing surveillance data addressing case counts (including zero cases if applicable) and status of contact tracing (if indicated)  Sharing information on travel history of cases and identified contacts to facilitate coordinated response on both sides of the border  Regularly reviewing the epidemic response and taking action to improve epidemic control actions as indicated  Documenting and communicate epidemic response actions escalating notifications as needed  1.15 References The IHR Review Committee on Second Extensions for Establishing National Public Health Capacities and on IHR Implementation (WHA 68/22 Add.1) Disaster Risk Management Strategy: A strategy for the Health Sector in the African Region.

However, to highlight the linkage between surveillance and response, the strategy was later re-named Integrated Disease Surveillance and Response (IDSR). Malawi adopted the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in 2005. Since then, there has been an investment in human and material resources to strengthen capacities for public health surveillance systems in order to prevent, timely detect, and respond appropriately to public health threats.  The coming into force, in 2007, of the International Health Regulations (IHR 2005), the emergence of new diseases, conditions and events and the formulation of strategies for disaster risk management (DRM) resulted in the need to revise the first edition of the IDSR technical guidelines. There was also the need to address the increasing burden of non-communicable diseases. Furthermore, there was the need to strengthen community-based surveillance for early detection, rapid confirmation and response to public health threats. Moreover, alignment with broader system strengthening objectives was required. Hence, in 2010, the second edition of the IDSR guidelines was developed, which Malawi subsequently adapted in 2014. Diseases, both communicable and non-communicable, continue to be a major cause of morbidity and mortality in Malawi and in the Africa region as a whole despite the advanced global knowledge on how to detect and control them. Of late, non-communicable diseases are increasingly becoming a major public health problem in the country. The majority of non-communicable diseases are preventable but multiple factors which include environmental, social, and economic determinants hamper effective prevention and control of these diseases. Emerging and re-emerging diseases and conditions pose a threat to the country’s health security.  Responding to health emergencies remains a major challenge, as shown by recent health emergencies in the country as well as the African region, the unprecedented Ebola Virus Disease of 2014, the ongoing Coronavirus Disease of 2019 Pandemic. Specifically, challenges in capacity to prevent, detect and respond to public health threats have been identified. As one way of addressing these problems, the Ministry of Health is strengthening the disease surveillance systems using the Third Edition of the guidelines for IDSR as revised by the WHO-AFRO in 2018 and adapted to our context in 2020. It is worth noting that, many Public Health Events (PHEs) and emergencies and their associated risk factors could be prevented or their effects mitigated. However, the health systems in most countries remain inadequate. To avert and mitigate the effects of future health security risks and emergencies, Malawi intends to  implement these IDSR technical guidelines. These guidelines recommend thresholds for action for priority diseases, conditions, public health events and responding to alerts. Using these action thresholds can be lifesaving. Therefore, it is important that we scale up and fully implement this third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines in the country as they explicitly describe what needs to be established at each level of the health system in order to detect, confirm and respond to diseases, conditions and health events that are responsible for  illness, deaths and disability in local communities. The cost of good public health surveillance as a public health good is relatively very low compared to many other strategies. Let us all embrace these IDSR technical guidelines to strengthen capacities for preparedness, alert and response for health security in the country. These guidelines are to be used by all relevant multisectoral stakeholders at all levels as general reference for surveillance activities, set of standard definitions for threshold levels that initiate action for responding to specific diseases, stand-alone reference for level-specific responsibilities, resource for developing training, supervision, monitoring and evaluation of surveillance activities, and as a guide for improving early detection and response of epidemic prone diseases. Finally, I appeal to you all to ensure that the third edition of the IDSR technical guidelines are implemented within a broader context of health system strengthening; better coordination between human and animal health surveillance and other sectors involved in One Health approach; improved use of laboratory network capacity in surveillance and response; and better community engagement in public health interventions.

It provides disease/event/condition specific guidance to: Take action to respond to alerts and action thresholds, Identify surveillance goals and objectives,  Surveillance data analysis and interpretation, Prepare to use the district analysis workbook or database, Standard case definitions for reporting diseases/event s/conditions. When adapting these guidelines each country will create its list of priority diseases/events/conditions depending on the local epidemiological situation. The priority list could vary from country to country depending on national policy and resources. This section is intended as a rapid reference. When additional information is required, please use the detailed references listed in the summary. The table below shows how information is organized in this section. Priority disease/event/condition for IDSR Background\\ufdd0In this sub-section, you will find general information about:\\u2029The disease or event, the causative agent, geographic range affected and other epidemiologic information.\\u2029Transmission routes such as person-to-person, unprotected contact with infectious body fluids or contaminated materials, vector-borne, and so on.\\u2029Why the disease/event is a priority for surveillance. For example, the disease/event is responsible for a high number of deaths, disability and illness, \\u2029General and specific risk factors in African countries.\\u2029Any additional background information that might serve the district surveillance team.\\u2029\\ufdd0Surveillance Goal\\ufdd0This sub-section states how the surveillance information is used for action.\\u2029\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case: A definition is provided for suspecting a case or outbreak of this disease or event.\\u2029Probable case: A definition is provided for a suspected case with epidemiological link to a confirmed case or an outbreak if laboratory confirmation results are not available. Confirmed case: A definition is provided for classifying a case as confirmed through laboratory diagnostic testing.\\u2029\\ufdd0Respond to alert threshold\\u2029Some diseases or events have program specific thresholds for alerting the health facility or district to a potential problem. \\u2029For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a single case is a suspected outbreak and requires immediate reporting followed by patient treatment, collection of specimens for case confirmation, and investigation of the case to determine the risk factors and potential interventions.\\u2029\\u2029For other priority diseases of public health importance, an outbreak or event is suspected when there is any unusual cluster, pattern, or increase in the number of cases when compared with previous time periods. This should prompt a response such as investigating what might have caused the unusual events. If laboratory confirmation is indicated, specimens should be collected for laboratory confirmation.\\u2029\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0For epidemic-prone diseases, diseases targeted for elimination or eradication, or public health events of international concern, a confirmed case should trigger a response such as conducting an emergency immunization activity, enhancing access to safe drinking water, community education campaigns, and improving case management.\\u2029For other priority diseases of public health importance, a confirmed outbreak should prompt an appropriate response such as improving coverage for specified immunizations, strengthening case management, providing information, education and communication about preventing and controlling the disease, and so on.\\u2029\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0This sub-section contains generic information about the minimum data elements to collect, analyse and interpret. The key points to consider for interpreting the data and specific elements for analysis are also stated (time, place, and person).\\ufdd0Laboratory confirmation\\ufdd0In this sub-section, guidelines on laboratory confirmation are provided including: relevant diagnostic  tests, how to collect, store and transport the specimens needed for laboratory confirmation, and information on the results of laboratory work.\\ufdd0Reference\\ufdd0Appropriate references for further information stated for each disease. Most are available from the WHO website. Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome Background\\ufdd0Acute haemorrhagic fever syndromes can be attributable to Ebola and Marburg viral diseases (Filoviridae);    Lassa fever (arenaviridae), Rift Valley fever (RVF) and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) (Bunyaviridae); dengue (dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF)) and yellow fever (Flaviviridae); and other viral, bacterial or rickettsial diseases with potential to produce epidemics.\\u2029All cases of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome whether single or in clusters, should be immediately notified without waiting for the causal agent to be identified.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Early detection of acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the cause of all suspected cases. Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing. During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used (e.g. case definitions for Ebola-Marburg, CCHF, RVF, Lassa, DHF, and yellow fever).\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case: Acute onset of fever of less than 3 weeks duration in a severely ill patient/ or a dead person AND any 2 of the following; haemorrhagic or purpuric rash; epistaxis (nose bleed); haematemesis (blood in vomit); haemoptysis (blood in sputum); blood in stool; other haemorrhagic symptoms and no known predisposing factors for haemorrhagic manifestations OR clinical suspicion of any of the viral diseases.\\u2029Probable case: A suspected case with epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak, but laboratory specimens are not available or awaited\\u2029Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation.\\u2029Note: During an outbreak, case definitions may be changed to correspond to the local event. It is important to note that during outbreaks, most cases might not show haemorrhagic manifestation, a proper history taking is crucial Respond to alert threshold\\ufdd0 If a single case is suspected:\\u2029Report case-based information immediately to the appropriate levels.\\u2029Suspected cases should be isolated from other patients/people and strict infection prevention procedures should be implemented. Standard precautions should be enhanced throughout the health care setting and in communities.\\u2029Treat and manage the patient with supportive care.\\u2029Collect the appropriate specimen while observing strict infection prevention and control procedures to confirm the case.\\u2029Complete a laboratory request form, use triple packaging of the specimens (see detailed SOP for triple packaging) and mark well the containers to warn of a potential laboratory biosafety risk\\u2029Conduct case-contact tracing and follow-up and active case search for additional cases (See detailed SOP for contact tracing and follow up).\\u2029Begin or enhance death reporting and surveillance; as well as screening procedures for fever and VHD related symptoms\\u2029 Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0If a single case is confirmed:\\u2029Maintain strict viral haemorrhagic disease (VHD) infection prevention and control (IPC) practices* throughout the outbreak.\\u2029Mobilize the community for early detection and care and conduct community education about how the disease is transmitted and how to implement IPC in the home care setting and during funerals and burials. Consider social distancing strategies.\\u2029Conduct case-contact follow-up and active searches for additional cases that may not come to the health care setting.\\u2029Request additional help from other levels as needed.\\u2029Establish an isolation ward or treatment centre to handle additional cases that may come to the health centre and ensure strict IPC measures to avoid transmission in health care settings.\\u2029Suspected cases should be isolated and treated for more common conditions with similar symptoms, which might include malaria, typhoid, louse borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. Ensure a barrier is instituted between suspected and confirmed cases.\\u2029Provide psychosocial support for the family, community and staff.\\u2029Consider quarantine for high risk contacts with home support during the incubation period and ensure daily follow up of their movements.\\u2029There are promising vaccine candidates under development for some VHDs that might be useful to be used in the event of outbreak in a ring vaccination approach and for health care workers.\\u2029Treat conservatively the symptoms which might be presented; severe cases require intensive support care; if dehydrated ensure fluid replacement with fluids that contain electrolytes.\\u2029A range of potential treatment options including blood products, immune therapies, and drug therapies are currently being evaluated,\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths. Analyse age and sex distribution. Assess risk factors and plan outbreak response interventions accordingly.\\u2029Time:Graph cases and deaths daily/weekly. Construct an epidemic curve during the outbreak.\\u2029Place:Map locations of cases’ households and work sites. If you have a GPS gadget, this will add to understand exact location of the cases; as well as contacts. Laboratory confirmation: Acute haemorrhagic fever syndrome\\ufdd0Diagnostic test\\ufdd0Laboratory confirmed cases must test positive for the virus antigen, either by detection of virus RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR), or by detection of IgM antibodies directed against Ebola/Marburg, CCHF, Lassa or West Nile Fever \\ufdd0Specimen\\ufdd0For ELISA: Whole blood, serum or plasma\\u2029\\u2029For RT-PCR: Whole blood or blood clot, serum/plasma or tissue\\u2029For immunohisto-chemistry: Skin or tissue specimens from fatal cases\\u2029NB: Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs)o theoretically can be performed in any health care setting and without additional equipment, however, use of an RDT may result in both false positive and false negative test results. A nucleic-acid based (e.g., PCR) diagnostic assay, such as GeneXpert, must be used to confirm the RDT result. Recent guidance from WHO recommends that antigen detection RDT’s for VHDs have no role in the routine management of VHDs in settings where PCR testing is available.  However, they may have utility in settings without laboratory infrastructure and where specimens cannot be rapidly transported to a diagnostic laboratory, if their benefits and limitations are understood.\\ufdd0When to collect the specimen\\ufdd0Collect specimen from all suspected patients.\\u2029All cases must be investigated, with contact tracing. Blood samples and appropriate clinical specimens must be collected to confirm a diagnosis as rapidly as possible.\\ufdd0How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen HANDLE AND TRANSPORT SPECIMENS FROM SUSPECTED VHF PATIENTS WITH EXTREME CAUTION. WEAR PROTECTIVE CLOTHING AND USE FULL PPE.\\u2029For ELISA or PCR:\\u2029Refrigerate serum or clot\\u2029Freeze (-20oC or colder) tissue specimens for virus isolation\\u2029For Immunohistochemistry:\\u2029Fix skin snip specimen in formalin. Specimen can be stored up to 6 weeks. The specimen is not infectious once it is in formalin.\\u2029Store at room temperature. Formalin-fixed specimens may be transported at room temperature.\\ufdd0Results Diagnostic services for VHF are not routinely available. Advance arrangements are usually required for VHF diagnostic services.

Women in the third trimester of pregnancy are especially susceptible to fulminant HEV disease.\\u2029Both HAV and HEV are transmitted via the faecal-oral route.\\u2029Prevention and control measures for hepatitis A and hepatitis E include adequate supplies of safe-drinking water and improvement of sanitary and hygienic practices to eliminate faecal contamination of food and water.\\u2029Viral hepatitis B and viral hepatitis C:\\u2029Estimates indicate that worldwide, there are 257 million carriers of hepatitis B virus and 71 million carriers of hepatitis C virus.\\u2029Acute Hepatitis B and C may be anicteric and thus unrecognized, but acute outbreaks are uncommon. \\u2029Chronic infection and severe sequelae occur with hepatitis B – an estimated 15% to 25% of chronically infected persons will die prematurely of either cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma. Chronic Hepatitis C infection is also common and 5% to 20% of those infected with HCV may develop cirrhosis. The risk of hepatocellular carcinoma in persons with HCV cirrhosis is 2-4% per year. \\u2029Hepatitis B is transmitted by percutaneous or per mucosal exposure to blood or other infectious body fluids. In most countries where HBV is highly endemic, most acute infections occur during infancy, early childhood or via perinatal transmission from mother to infant. Other important routes of transmission include nosocomial exposure (transfusions, unsafe injection practices), shared needles or syringes among injecting drug users, household contact (e.g., communally used razors and toothbrushes) and sexual contact with an infected person. \\u2029Hepatitis C is transmitted by parenteral exposure to blood and plasma derivatives. It is found in highest concentrations in blood.

Report of CIOMS/WHO Working Group on Vaccine Pharmacovigilance. Geneva, Council for International Organizations of Medical Sciences, 2012 Anthrax (human) Background\\ufdd0Anthrax is a widespread zoonotic disease caused by the spore-forming bacterium Bacillus anthracis, a Gram positive rod-shaped bacterium. A. It is transmitted from infected domestic livestock (cattle, sheep, goats, buffaloes, pigs and others) or wild game animals to humans by direct contact or indirect contact with animals or their products.\\u2029The incubation period typically ranges from 1 to 7 days, but may be longer (up to two to three weeks for cutaneous anthrax and up to 42 days for inhalation anthrax). Persons exposed to occupational hazards include those handling infected carcasses and those employed in the processing of bones, hides, wool and other animal products. Persons may also become infected by handling or consuming meat from animals that are sick with or have died of the disease. Biting flies have been reported to transmit the disease from infected animals to humans however how readily or often this occurs is unknown.\\u2029Human anthrax is a serious problem in several countries and has potential for explosive outbreaks (especially the gastrointestinal form that is contracted from eating infected meat); while pulmonary (inhalation) anthrax is mainly occupational, the threat of biological warfare attacks should not be forgotten. Anthrax has a serious impact on the trade of animal products.\\u2029The control of anthrax is based on its prevention in livestock. Programmes based only on prevention in humans are costly and likely to be ineffective except for those industrially exposed.\\u2029There is an effective vaccine for those persons considered at risk for occupational exposure, and successful vaccines are used for livestock, particularly for herds with ongoing exposure to contaminated soil or vegetation.\\u2029In most countries anthrax is a notifiable disease.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0To detect outbreaks.\\u2029To monitor control and prevention programmes Standard case definition: Anthrax (Human)\\ufdd0 Suspected case\\u2029 Any person with acute onset characterized by several clinical forms which are:\\u2029Cutaneous form: Any person with skin lesion evolving over 1 to 6 days from a papular through a vesicular stage, to a depressed black eschar invariably accompanied by oedema that may be mild to extensive.\\u2029Gastro-intestinal: Any person with abdominal distress characterized by nausea, vomiting, anorexia and followed by fever\\u2029Pulmonary (inhalation): any person with brief prodromal resembling acute viral respiratory illness, followed by rapid onset of hypoxia, dyspnoea and high temperature, with X-ray evidence of mediastinal widening\\u2029Meningeal: Any person with acute onset of high fever possibly with convulsions, loss of consciousness, meningeal signs and symptoms; commonly noted in all systemic infections, but may present without any other clinical symptoms of anthrax.\\u2029 AND has an epidemiological link to confirmed or suspected animal cases or contaminated animal products\\ufdd0 Confirmed case\\u2029 A confirmed case of anthrax in a human can be defined as a clinically compatible case of cutaneous,   \\u2029 inhalational or gastrointestinal illness that is laboratory-confirmed by:\\u2029isolation of B. anthracis from an affected tissue or site; OR\\u2029Other laboratory evidence of B. anthracis infection based on at least two supportive laboratory tests.\\u2029 Note: it may not be possible to demonstrate B. anthracis in clinical specimens if the patient has been treated with antimicrobial agents.

In these countries, large outbreaks may occur during the dry season (November through May). Outside of the meningitis belt, smaller outbreaks may occur year-round. \\u2029Epidemics in the meningitis belt were traditionally associated with Neisseria meningitidis serogroup A before the introduction of a meningococcal A conjugate vaccine (MACV) (MenAfriVac vaccine) into meningitis belt countries starting in 2010. MACV is immunogenic in both infants and adults and confers long-term protection. It has dramatically reduced the circulation of Nm A and eliminated Nm A epidemics.\\u2029Epidemics from other serogroups continue to occur: since 2013 major epidemics due to Nm serogroup C occurred in Nigeria and Niger. From 2016 to 2018, major mixed epidemics of Neisseria meningitidis  serogroup W and Streptococcus pneumoniae have been reported in Ghana. In 2016 and 2017 Togo reported epidemics due to Nm serogroup W. In addition, in 2006 Burkina and Niger reported an epidemic due to Nm serogroup X.\\u2029Human-to-human disease transmission is via large respiratory droplets from the nose and throats of infected people.\\u2029Incubation period is 2 to 10 days.\\u2029Attack rates are highest among children aged less than 15 years. Case fatality rates are usually 8-15% among treated patients, and >70% among untreated cases. Many survivors suffer long-term sequelae including mental retardation, hearing loss and loss of limb use.\\u2029Ceftriaxone is the drug of choice for treatment during epidemics because it is effective on the predominant meningitis pathogens. In addition, antimicrobial resistance to ceftriaxone has not yet been detected in Africa.\\u2029During epidemics in the meningitis belt, antibiotic prophylaxis is not recommended\\u2029The current response to meningitis epidemics consists of reactive mass vaccination campaigns with bivalent (A C) or trivalent/quatrivalent polysaccharide vaccine (A, C, W/ A, C, Y W) as soon as possible after an epidemic has been declared. Polysaccharide vaccines do not protect very young children (<2 years) and only provide protection for up to three years.\\u2029\\ufdd0Surveillance goals\\ufdd0To promptly detect meningitis outbreaks and to confirm aetiology of meningitis outbreaks.\\u2029To use the data to plan for treatment and vaccination supplies and other prevention and control measures.\\u2029To assess and monitor the spread and progress of the epidemic and the effectiveness of control measures.\\u2029To monitor the epidemiology of meningitis including serogroup shifts.\\u2029To monitor antibiotic susceptibility.

The disease resembles dengue fever, and is characterized by severe, sometimes persistent, joint pain (arthritis), as well as fever and rash. It is rarely life-threatening. Nevertheless, widespread occurrence of diseases causes substantial morbidity and economic loss.\\u2029The word \"Chikungunya\" is Makonde for \"that which bends up,\" in reference to the stooped posture of patients afflicted with the severe joint pain associated with the disease. Epidemics of fever, rash and arthritis, resembling Chikungunya fever were recorded as early as 1779. However, the virus was first isolated between 1952-1953 from both man and mosquitoes during an epidemic in Tanzania.\\u2029Chikungunya historically displayed interesting epidemiological profiles in that: major epidemics appeared and disappeared cyclically, usually with an inter-epidemic period of 7-8 years and sometimes as long as 20 years. After a long period of absence, outbreaks appeared in Indonesia in 1999 and have been virtually ongoing since 2004.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0 Detect Chikungunya sporadic cases and outbreaks early, and seek laboratory verification.\\u2029 Identify high risk areas in order to improve prevention of outbreaks by taking steps to avoid mosquito bites and elimination of breeding sites.\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\u2029\\ufdd0Acute clinical case\\u2029Clinical criterion: Fever >38.50 C (101.30F) and joint pain a (usually incapacitating b) with acute onset      AND \\u2029Epidemiological criterion: resident or visitor in areas with local transmission of Chikungunya on the last 15 days (suspected case for epidemiological surveillance)    OR\\u2029Laboratory criterion: confirmation by laboratory: PCR, serology or viral culture (confirmed case for epidemiological surveillance)\\u2029Atypical case\\u2029Clinical case of laboratory confirmed Chikungunya accompanied by other manifestations: neurological, cardiological, dermatological, ophthalmological, hepatic, renal, respiratory, or haematological, among others.\\u2029Severe acute case\\u2029Clinical case of laboratory-confirmed chikungunya presenting dysfunction of at least one organ or system that threatens life and requires hospitalization\\u2029Suspected and confirmed chronic cases\\u2029Suspect chronic case: Person with previous clinical diagnosis of chikungunya after 12 weeks of the onset of the symptoms presenting with at least one of the following articular manifestations: pain, rigidity, or edema, continuously or recurrently.  \\u2029Confirmed chronic case: Every chronic case with a positive chikungunya laboratory test\\u2029\\u2029   a Usually accompanied by exanthema, myalgia, back pain, headache and, occasionally, vomiting and diarrhoea (pediatric age  \\u2029     group).\\u2029  b In children aged <3 years, joint pain is expressed as inconsolable crying, irritability, rejection to mobilization and/or walking.\\ufdd0 Respond to alert threshold\\ufdd0If Chikungunya cases are suspected:\\u2029Report case-based information immediately to the next level\\u2029Collect specimens for confirming the cases\\u2029Conduct an investigation to determine the risk factors for transmission\\u2029Manage and treat the cases using acetaminophen or paracetamol to relieve fever and non-steroidal anti- inflammatory agents\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0If Chikungunya cases are confirmed\\u2029Symptomatic treatment for mitigating pain and fever using non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs along with rest usually suffices.

The disease is transmitted mainly through the faecal-oral route; that is through eating or drinking contaminated food or water.\\u2029Cholera causes over 100 000 deaths per year. It may produce rapidly progressive epidemics or worldwide pandemics. In endemic areas, sporadic cases (less than 5% of all non-outbreak-related diarrhoea cases) and small outbreaks may occur.\\u2029Incubation period is from a few hours to 5 days, usually in the range of from 2 to 3 days.\\u2029There has been a resurgence of cholera in Africa since the mid-1980s, where over 80% of the world’s cases occurred in 1999. The majority of cases occurred from January through April. In 2016, globally, 38 countries reported a total of 132 121 cases. Of cases reported globally, 54% were from Africa, 13% from Asia and 32% from Hispaniola. Imported cases were reported in 9 countries.\\u2029Cholera may cause severe dehydration in only a few hours. In untreated patients with severe dehydration, the case fatality rate (CFR) may exceed 50%. If patients present at the health facility and correct treatment is received, the CFR is usually less than 1%. At least 90% of the cases are mild, and they remain undiagnosed.\\u2029Risk factors: eating or drinking contaminated foods such as uncooked seafood or shellfish from estuarine waters, lack of continuous access to safe water and food supplies, attending large gatherings of people including ceremonies such as weddings or funerals, contact with persons who died of cholera.\\u2029Other enteric diarrhoea may cause watery diarrhoea, especially in children less than 5 years of age.

Dengue is caused by four serologically distinct, but closely related viruses: dengue virus (DENV) 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the Flaviviridae family.\\u2029Dengue fever is an emerging pandemic that has spread globally during the past 30 years as a result of changes in human ecology. Dengue is found in tropical and sub-tropical regions around the world, predominately in urban and semi-urban areas. During dengue epidemics, infection rates among those who have not been previously exposed to the virus are often 40% to 50%, but can reach 80% to 90%.\\u2029Dengue fever is a severe, influenza-like illness that affects infants, young children and adults, but seldom causes death. Dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) is a potentially deadly complication that has become a leading cause of hospitalization and death among children in Asia. There is good evidence that sequential infection with the different serotypes of dengue virus increases the risk of more severe disease that can result in dengue shock syndrome (DSS) and death.\\u2029Epidemic dengue activity in Africa has mostly been classical dengue fever caused by DENV-1 and DENV-2 without associated mortality. The first major outbreak of DENV-3 in Africa was documented in Mozambique in 1984-1985. During this outbreak, most patients experienced secondary infections and 2 deaths were attributed to DHF and shock. In 2008, yellow fever and DENV-3 were found to be co-circulating in Abidjan, Cote d’Ivoire, however, no severe dengue cases or deaths attributable to dengue were identified.\\u2029There is no specific treatment for dengue, but appropriate medical care frequently saves the lives of patients with dengue haemorrhagic fever.\\u2029Infected humans are the main carriers and multipliers of the virus, serving a source of the virus for uninfected Aedes aegypti mosquitoes which maintain the urban dengue transmission cycle. The virus circulates in the blood of infected human for 2-7 days, at approximately the same time that they have a fever. A sylvatic transmission cycle has been documented in west Africa where DENV-2 has been found in monkeys. There is no evidence of person-to-person transmission.\\u2029At present, the only method of controlling or preventing dengue virus transmission is to combat the vector mosquitoes using environmental management and chemical methods.\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Surveillance for suspected cases and investigation of clusters of suspected cases in areas with Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopiticus mosquitoes\\ufdd0 Standard case definition: Dengue Fever\\ufdd0Dengue Fever Suspected case: Any person with acute febrile illness of 2-7 days duration with 2 or more of the following: headache, retro-orbital pain, myalgia, arthralgia, rash, haemorrhagic manifestations, leucopenia.\\u2029Dengue Fever Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, four-fold or greater rise in IgG antibody titres, positive PCR or viral isolation).\\u2029Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever: A probable or confirmed case of dengue with bleeding tendencies as evidenced by one or more of the following: positive tourniquet test; petechieae, ecchymoses or purpura; bleeding: mucosa, gastrointestinal tract, injection sites or other; haematemesis or melaena; and thrombocytopenia (100 000 cells or less per mm3) and evidence of plasma leakage due to increased vascular permeability, manifested by one or more of the following: 20% rise in average haematocrit for age and sex, 20% drop in haematocrit following volume replacement therapy compared to baseline, signs of plasma leakage (pleural effusion, ascites, hypo-proteinaemia).\\u2029Dengue Shock Syndrome: All the above criteria, plus evidence of circulatory failure manifested by rapid and weak pulse, and narrow pulse pressure (≤ 20 mm Hg) or hypotension for age, cold, clammy skin and altered mental status.\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Respond to alert threshold: Dengue Fever\\ufdd0If a single case is suspected:\\u2029Report case-based information immediately to the next level.\\u2029Conduct active search for additional cases\\u2029Collect specimens for confirming the cases\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0If a single case is confirmed:\\u2029Report case-based information immediately to the next level and initiate a line list/register of suspected cases\\u2029Conduct active search for additional cases\\u2029Collect specimens for confirming the cases and ensure results are linked with cases\\u2029Survey the community to determine the abundance of vector mosquitoes, identify the most productive larval habitats, promote and implement plans for their elimination, management or treatment with appropriate larvicides.\\u2029Educate the public and promote behaviours to remove, destroy or manage mosquito vector larval habitats.\\u2029Manage and provide supportive treatment to dengue fever cases.

Diabetes can cause serious health complications including heart disease, blindness, kidney failure, and lower-extremity amputations.\\u2029The most common form is Type 2 diabetes that represents more than 85% of the cases. Other forms are less common such as Type 1 (10% of cases), specific diabetes and gestational diabetes (5% of cases).\\u2029The risk factors that affect the onset of diabetes are well-known. They comprise non-modifiable factors like old age (over 45 years of age), family history, and the causes of diabetes in pregnancy. Modifiable risk factors for diabetes are obesity, physical inactivity and excessive alcohol consumption.\\u2029The global prevalence in 2000 was estimated at 2.8%, with projections of 4.8% by 2030. The total number of persons affected will rise from 171 million in 2000 to 366 million in 2030 if no action is taken. Annual mortality linked to diabetes worldwide is estimated at more than one million.\\u2029Diabetes is no longer considered rare in Africa. Recent estimates based on the WHO STEP-wise approach for monitoring the risk factors of non-communicable diseases indicate prevalence of between 1% and 20%. In some countries such as Mauritius, it reaches 20%.\\u2029The rate of limb amputations due to diabetes varies from 1.4% to 6.7% of diabetic foot cases. In some African countries, the mortality rate is higher than 40 per 10,000 inhabitants.\\u2029In the African Region, efforts made to create an environment that enhances the fight against diabetes include adoption of resolutions on non-communicable diseases in 2000, cardiovascular diseases strategy in 2005, and diabetes mellitus strategy in 2007.

ISBN 92 4 068750 5 Dracunculiasis (Guinea Worm Disease)  Background\\ufdd0Dracunculiasis is commonly known as Guinea worm disease. It is caused by a large nematode, a disabling parasite that emerges through the skin of the infected person.\\u2029This is an old disease, known since antiquity, inflicting an excruciating pain on affected individuals and usually causing temporary disability, leaving many patients with unfortunate socio-economic consequences. It is transmitted through ingestion of water containing a crustacean (cyclops) which is infested by an immature form (larvae) of the nematode. The Cyclops is found in stagnant surface water sources (ponds, traditional shallow wells). The female nematode discharges larvae from the host’s skin when there is contact with water. The incubation period is usually between 10 to 14 months. There is no treatment or vaccine against the disease.\\u2029Successful disease elimination strategies conducted by the endemic countries and an international coalition of partners has pushed Dracunculiasis towards eradication. During 2017, only 30 cases of Guinea worm disease worldwide were reported to WHO, compared to 892 000 in 1989, showing a reduction of 99.99%.\\u2029In 1989, the disease was endemic in 20 countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Côte d’Ivoire, Chad, Ghana, Ethiopia, India, Pakistan, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Sudan, Senegal, Togo, Uganda and Yemen.\\u2029Africa remains the only affected continent, with 5 countries having reported infection emanating from indigenous transmission of the parasite either in human and/or in animal in 2018: Angola, Chad, Ethiopia, Mali and South Sudan.\\u2029Since, 2012, emerging worms from animals, mostly dogs, and in a few instances, cats and baboons, have been reported in some of the remaining endemic countries and confirmed in the WHO Collaborating Centre at CDC for Dracunculiasis Eradication laboratory, as Dracunculus medinensis. Accordingly, dracunculiasis eradication, which was previously based on interrupting transmission in human, will now include interrupting transmission in both human and animal hosts.2 Surveillance goal: Dracunculiasis\\ufdd0Active detection and containment of cases at the community level and immediate reporting to the health centre, with immediate notification to the health district, regional and national level. This should subsequently be followed by weekly and monthly reporting of cases to the next level.\\u2029In zones where local transmission of Guinea worm has been interrupted, maintain active searches for cases in high-risk areas and promptly follow-up and investigate all rumours of dracunculiasis (within 24 hours of notification) reported through the national surveillance system and/or directly by community members.\\u2029Report all imported cases to countries or areas of origin for further follow up investigation to trace the source of infection for further action.\\u2029Integrate dracunculiasis surveillance into National Surveillance systems and continue to report immediately/weekly/monthly, and also according to national reporting system.\\u2029Use opportunities of other community-based health activities (e. g. NID campaigns for Polio and other vaccinations, NTD Mapping, Mass drug administration, ITN and other health commodities distribution, etc.), to conduct active case search for dracunculiasis, and document results.\\u2029Continue publicity of the cash reward for reporting Dracunculiasis\\u2029Systematically document and properly store information /surveillance data related to Guinea worm surveillance, to serve as evidence for future certification, and beyond until Global eradication is declared.\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0Standard case definitions: Dracunculiasis\\ufdd0 Rumour\\u2029Information about the occurrence of Guinea worm disease (Dracunculiasis) from any source.\\u2029 Suspected case\\u2029A person presenting a skin lesion with itching or blister living in an endemic area or risk areas for Guinea worm, with the emergence of a worm.\\u2029 Confirmed case\\u2029A case of guinea-worm disease is a person exhibiting a skin lesion with emergence of a Guinea worm, and in which the worm is confirmed in laboratory tests to be D. medinensis. That person is counted as a case only once during the calendar year, i.e. when the first worm emerges from that person. All worm specimens should be obtained from each case patient for laboratory confirmation and sent to the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). All cases should be monitored at least twice per month during the remainder of the calendar year for prompt detection of possible emergence of additional guinea worms. 267\\u2029267Respond to alert threshold: Dracunculiasis\\ufdd0As a disease targeted for eradication, every rumour or suspected case of Guinea worm disease is an emergency.\\u2029Follow up and investigate any rumour of dracunculiasis (within 24 hours of notification), using the national programme guidelines and WHO recommended forms, in order to determine whether or not there is a suspected case requiring further follow-up, monitoring and specimen collection for laboratory investigation.\\u2029If a single case is suspected:\\u2029Report the case according to national program guidelines for eradication of Dracunculiasis.\\u2029Treat the wound (if any) to decrease disability associated with painful leg lesions.\\u2029Collect and preserve specimen of any emerged worm in 70% alcohol, according to WHO /National guidelines for specimen handling, and send to WHO Country Office for onward transmission to WHO Collaborating Centre at CDC, for laboratory analysis\\u2029Conduct case investigation to confirm risk factors and assess the source and burden of infection.\\u2029Improve access to safe water according to national guidelines.\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time:Graph cases monthly.\\u2029Place:Plot distributions of localities (communities) from which cases have been reported.\\u2029Person: Count monthly cases and analyse age distribution. Use data to forecast interventions. Report monthly to   next levels.\\ufdd0 Laboratory confirmation\\ufdd0A clinical diagnosis is usually made when the blister has ruptured, and the anterior end of the female worm can be seen, and the worm emerges. Current programme standards require that the emerged worm is sent to the laboratory for confirmation as D. medinensis. Several other worms emerging from the skin may mimic Guinea worm disease, notably onchocerciasis and sparganosis, and should be differentiated from dracunculiasis through laboratory confirmation.  Collect and preserve any emerged specimen according to WHO/ National guidelines for specimen handling and send to WHO Country office for onward transmission to WHO Collaborating Centre at CDC for laboratory analysis (mandatory).

Ebola or Marburg virus diseases Background\\ufdd0The Ebola and Marburg viruses are both filoviruses.\\u2029Almost 3,000 cases of Ebola with over 1,900 deaths have been documented since the Ebola virus was discovered in 1976. Major Ebola outbreaks have occurred in Sudan, DRC, Cote d’Ivoire, Gabon, Uganda and Congo.\\u2029More than 500 cases of Marburg with over 400 deaths were reported during outbreaks of Marburg virus that occurred in DRC (1998-2000), Angola (2004-2005) and Uganda (3 cases in 2007).\\u2029These two viruses are transmitted by direct contact with the blood, secretions, organs or other body fluids of infected persons. The infection of humans with Ebola virus through the handling of infected chimpanzees, gorillas, and forest antelopes (alive and dead) has been documented.\\u2029Ecological studies are in progress to identify the natural reservoirs of both Marburg and Ebola. There is evidence that fruit bats are involved.\\u2029Epidemics can be dramatically amplified in health care facilities with inadequate infection control precautions/barrier nursing procedures.\\u2029Incubation period for Ebola and Marburg is 2 to 21 days.\\u2029Between 20% and 80% of patients have haemorrhagic manifestations depending on the Ebola or Marburg virus strain. Patients become increasingly infectious as their illness progresses.\\u2029High case fatality ratios have been reported during Ebola outbreaks (25% to 90%) and during Marburg outbreaks (25% to 80%)\\u2029There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes.\\u2029Close contact with a severely ill patient, during care at home or in hospital, and certain burial practices are common routes of infection. Transmission via contaminated injection equipment or through needle-stick injuries is associated with more severe disease. Infection may also be spread through contact with soiled clothing or bed linens from an infected patient.\\ufdd0Surveillance goals\\ufdd0Early detection of cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the aetiology of all suspected cases.\\u2029Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing.\\u2029During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms and a specific case definition according to the suspected or confirmed disease should be used.\\u2029Prevention efforts such as social distancing and vaccination should be supported. \\u2029Monitoring case fatalities, assess spread of illness (chains of transmission), and death. \\u2029Guide the support and care of survivors\\ufdd0Standard case definition: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases\\ufdd0Routine Surveillance:\\u2029Suspected case: Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area, and at least one of the following signs: bloody diarrhoea, bleeding from gums, bleeding into skin (purpura), bleeding into eyes and urine.\\u2029Confirmed case: A suspected case with laboratory confirmation (positive IgM antibody, positive PCR or viral isolation), or epidemiologic link to confirmed cases or outbreak.\\u2029Community-based surveillance:\\u2029 Alert case: \\u2029Illness with onset of fever and no response to treatment of usual causes of fever in the area; \\u2029OR\\u2029At least one of the following signs: bleeding, bloody diarrhoea, bleeding into urine; \\u2029OR\\u2029Any sudden death \\u2029Actions to take: If an alert case (living or dead) is identified, report the case to a surveillance team or to the closest health centre \\u2029\\u2029This definition of “alert cases” for Ebola or Marburg virus disease has been developed for use by the community or community-based volunteers. It may be used for community-based surveillance during the pre-epidemic phase and during the outbreak.\\u2029\\u2029Note: During an outbreak, case definitions are likely to be adapted to new clinical presentation(s) or different modes of transmission related to the local event\\u2029In outbreak setting, the following standard case definitions may guide appropriate detection of cases:\\u2029Suspected case: Any person, alive or dead, suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: - a suspected, probable or confirmed Ebola or Marburg case; - a dead or sick animal (for Ebola) - a mine (for Marburg) OR\\u2029Any person with sudden onset of high fever and at least three of the following symptoms: - headaches - lethargy - anorexia / loss of appetite - aching muscles or joints - stomach pain - difficulty swallowing - vomiting - difficulty breathing - diarrhoea - hiccups; OR \\u2029Any person with inexplicable bleeding;  OR \\u2029Any sudden, inexplicable death; OR\\u2029A person (alive or dead) suffering or having suffered from a sudden onset of high fever and having had contact with: a dead or sick animal (for Ebola); a mine (for Marburg) \\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0Standard case definition: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases\\ufdd0Note: During epidemics, most infected patients do not show haemorrhagic symptoms, therefore, the case definition for suspected or confirmed case does not include it. \\u2029Probable case: \\u2029Any suspected case evaluated by a clinician; \\u2029OR \\u2029Any deceased suspected case (where it has not been possible to collect specimens for laboratory confirmation) having an epidemiological link with a confirmed case Note: if laboratory specimens are collected in due time during the illness, the preceding categories are reclassified as “laboratory confirmed” cases and “non-case”.\\u2029Laboratory confirmed case: Any suspected or probably cases with a positive laboratory result for virus presence. Laboratory confirmed cases must test positive for the virus, either by detection of virus RNA by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT- PCR), or by detection of IgM antibodies directed against Marburg or Ebola virus. \\u2029Non-Case: Any suspected or probable case with negative laboratory results. “Non-case” showed no specific antibodies, RNA or specific detectable antigens\\u2029\\ufdd0Respond to alert threshold: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases\\ufdd0If a single case is suspected:\\u2029If a single case is suspected: \\u2029Report case-based information immediately (phone or text with information from generic case investigation form) to the appropriate authorities. \\u2029Collect specimen to confirm the case(s).

Low risk contacts under daily follow-up should be encouraged to limit their movements\\u2029Begin surveillance and screening of dead bodies including: any individual aged 5 years or more, dying within 14 days of symptom onset from an indeterminate cause, OR still births.) \\u2029Treat accompanying similar symptoms, in particular malaria, typhoid, fever, louse-borne typhus, relapsing fever or leptospirosis. \\u2029Implement IPC measures and avoid nosocomial transmission by strict implementation of barrier nursing. If barrier nursing material is not available, avoid any invasive procedure (e.g. blood sampling, injections, placement of infusion lines, or nasogastric tubes) and put on at least one layer of gloves for any direct contact with the patient; double gloving is advised during invasive procedures (e.g., surgery) that poses an increased risk for blood exposure. \\u2029There is no specific treatment for either disease. Severe cases require intensive supportive care, as patients are frequently dehydrated and in need of intravenous fluids or oral rehydration with solutions containing electrolytes. \\u2029For EVD, a range of potential treatments including blood products, immune therapies and drug therapies are currently being evaluated.\\u2029\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data: Ebola or Marburg virus diseases\\ufdd0Person: Implement immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths.

A nucleic-acid based (e.g., PCR) diagnostic assay, such as GeneXpert, must be used to confirm the RDT result. Recent guidance from WHO recommends that antigen detection RDT’s for VHDs have no role in the routine management of VHDs in settings where PCR testing is available.  However, they may have utility in settings without laboratory infrastructure and where specimens cannot be rapidly transported to a diagnostic laboratory, if their benefits and limitations are understood.\\ufdd0When to collect\\ufdd0Collect specimen from the first suspected case.\\u2029If more than one suspected case, collect until specimens have been collected from 5 to10 suspected cases.\\ufdd0How to prepare, store, and transport\\ufdd0HANDLE AND TRANSPORT SPECIMENS FROM SUSPECTED VHF PATIENTS WITH EXTREME CAUTION.

Epilepsy Background\\ufdd0Epilepsy is defined as the recurrence of, at least, two epileptic seizures with sudden occurrence of abnormal signs which could be: motor, tonic, sensitive, sensorial, neuro-vegetative, or psycho-behavioural. These symptoms could or could not be associated to a loss of conscience. It can appear at any age.\\u2029Epilepsy is the most common result of brain cells disturbance that lead to excessive nerve-cell discharges. According to the disturbance on some or many groups of cells, seizures could be partial or generalized.\\u2029Seizures with tonic-clonic muscle movements are named convulsion or fit or attack. Convulsion can appear at any age; all convulsions are not systematically epilepsy.\\u2029Epilepsy is frequent in the Region and its prevalence rate range from 2.2 to 58 per 1000 persons. Studies from five sub-Saharan African countries showed an incidence ranging from 64 to 156 per 100,000 person/year.\\u2029This higher incidence may be a consequence of many risk factors which are related with predisposing factors such as poor perinatal care, head trauma, consanguinity.\\u2029Many etiological factors are related with communicable diseases (malaria, tuberculosis, meningitis, neurocysticerocisis and HIV), non-communicable diseases (high blood pressure, diabetes, alcoholism and illicit drug use), poorer medical facilities, poorer general health and a lower standard of living. Misunderstanding linked to cultural beliefs, sigma and exclusion do not facilitate appropriate care.\\u2029Epilepsy substantially increases mortality risk, particularly in conditions of later detection due to lack of well-trained health workers to diagnose and treat neurological disorders.\\u2029Death and injury occur primarily due to status epilepticus (especially in the case of abrupt medication withdrawal), burns and drowning.\\u2029\\u2029It has been estimated that in developing countries, up to 80% of people with epilepsy are not receiving treatment, or are often not even identified. While the etiological diagnosis of the epilepsies may be more difficult in developing countries, due to limited investigative resources, many can be diagnosed on the basis of simple clinical and epidemiological knowledge.\\ufdd0 Standard case definition: Epilepsy\\u2029\\ufdd0Suspected case: Any person with one epileptic seizure\\u2029Suspected new case: Report only the first diagnostic of the case in the health centre\\u2029Confirmed case:\\u2029Any person with recurrence of, at least, two epileptic seizures. A positive response to treatment with any antiepileptic (AED) strengthens the hypothesis of a confirmed case. Epileptic seizures can last for 30 seconds to 3 minutes. When they are intricate without a pause, they can lead to status epilepticus.\\ufdd0Respond to alert threshold\\ufdd0Suspected cases\\u2029All health personnel should check for early signs of epilepsy. Diagnosis should include good interviews (describing as precisely as possible the seizure type) and clinical examination.\\u2029Once diagnosed, search for underlying and associated causes. Check for abnormal increases on number of cases and propose appropriate environmental measures if needed.\\u2029Confirmed cases\\u2029Immediate treatment should be ensured starting with low doses of any anti-epileptic drug then increasing progressively until an effective steady state. In case of poor seizure control management strategies must be: increase the dose or try an alternative drug, refer to an upper level health structure.\\u2029Referral to higher level health structure should be done if seizures continue regardless of pharmacological treatment or if first seizure occurs in an adult aged 30 years and above.\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0All cases: Information and education measures on epilepsy and risk factors at community level\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Person: Analyse sex and age distribution (by age group from 6 years onwards) \\u2029Time: Graph quarterly cases\\u2029Place:Plot the distribution by area of residence Laboratory confirmation: Epilepsy\\ufdd0Diagnostic test\\ufdd0Blood glucose (random capillary blood, and venous blood sugar), electrolytes to exclude other conditions such as diabetes, kidney pathology\\u2029Exclude other conditions such as cerebral malaria, meningitis, toxoplasmosis; cerebral calcifications follow tuberculosis (tuberculoma), parasitic diseases and others by conducting appropriate medical investigations.\\ufdd0Specimen\\ufdd0Blood, and cerebro-spinal fluid\\ufdd0When to collect the specimen\\ufdd0Glucose – During the emergency admission of the patient (random blood glucose) Confirmed subsequently (fasting blood glucose)\\ufdd0How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen\\ufdd0Use universal precautions to minimize exposure to sharps and anybody fluid\\ufdd0Results\\ufdd0Results are always available within 1 to 3 hours from arrival in the laboratory\\ufdd0References :\\ufdd0WHO, Epilepsy in the WHO African Region: Bridging the Gap, WHO Regional Office for Africa, Congo, 2004.\\u2029WHO, Epilepsy: a manual for medical and clinical officers in Africa, WHO, Geneva 2002\\u2029 Foodborne Illnesses Background\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0Foodborne illnesses are caused by a variety of bacterial, viral, parasitic or fungal pathogens or their toxins that enter the body through consumption of food or water. In addition to diseases listed elsewhere in this guideline such as cholera, and shigellosis, surveillance for foodborne illnesses may involve other causes such as salmonellosis, hepatitis A or chemical contamination.\\u2029A foodborne illness occurs when two or more people have shared common food or drink followed by an onset of symptoms within a short time period.\\u2029Most people with a foodborne illness do not seek medical care, so cases and outbreaks of foodborne illness usually are neither recognized nor reported.\\u2029The first symptoms often occur in gastrointestinal tract. Nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps and diarrhoea are frequent symptoms of foodborne diseases.\\u2029Outbreaks may be localized affecting as few as 2 individuals who ate a common meal or product, but large and geographically widespread outbreaks may also occur.

It is classified as either primary (essential) or secondary. ‘Primary’ hypertension is elevated blood pressure where no medical cause is found. ‘Secondary’ hypertension is caused by other conditions that affect the arteries, heart, endocrine system or kidneys.\\u2029Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack or stroke. According to The World Health Report 2001, cardiovascular disease related deaths are increasing in the African Region, and in 2000 accounted for 9.2% of the total deaths in the African Region. Prevalence ranges from 25% to 35% in adults aged 25 to 64 years.\\u2029Hypertension affects approximately 1 billion worldwide and it is estimated that more than 20 million people in the African Region are affected.\\u2029Major risk factors for hypertension are ageing, lack of physical activity, obesity, and a diet high in salt and fat. Other risk factors include; tobacco and alcohol use.\\u2029Lifestyle modifications shown to lower BP include; weight reduction for individuals who are overweight or obese, reducing the amount of fat and salt in the diet, and eating more fresh fruits and vegetables, increased physical activity, and reduction of alcohol and tobacco consumption.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Prevention of secondary illness by early detection and standardized treatment\\u2029Estimation of disease burden and reduction of identified risk factors\\u2029Monitor control and prevention activities\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected new case at first visit:\\u2029Any individual presenting with a resting blood pressure measurement (based on the average of 3 readings) at or above 140 mm Hg for systolic pressure, or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg for diastolic pressure.\\u2029Confirmed case:\\u2029Any individual presenting on at least two occasions with a resting blood pressure measurement (based on the average of 3 readings) at or above 140 mm Hg for systolic pressure, or greater than or equal to 90 mm Hg for diastolic pressure.\\u2029* Report only the first diagnosis of the case in the health centre\\ufdd0Recommended public health action: Hypertension\\ufdd0Health promotion for non-communicable diseases focusing on HBP should be established, including community-based education on behaviour change and adoption of healthy lifestyles\\u2029Promote secondary prevention and treatment interventions at health facilities according to national guidelines.\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time: Graph cases quarterly to analyse trends.\\u2029Place: Compare district trends with national and regional trends.\\u2029Person: Analyse the distribution of cases by age and other demographic factors.\\u2029   *Data for non-communicable diseases is often analysed for long term trends\\ufdd0Laboratory confirmation\\ufdd0Diagnostic is clinical.\\ufdd0Reference\\ufdd0WHO, Atlas of heart disease and stroke, Geneva, World Health Organization, 2004.\\u2029Non communicable Diseases: A strategy for the African Region, AFR/RC50/10\\u2029Cardiovascular Diseases in the African Region: Current situation and perspectives, AFR/RC55/12\\u2029http://www.who.int/chp/steps/en/\\u2029http://www.afro.who.int/dnc/databases/afro infobase/index.html\\u2029WHO CVD-risk management package for low-and medium resource settings.\\u2029The Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure U.S. Department of health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, NIH Publication No. 03-5233, December 2003\\u2029Handbook of Hypertension, Vol 20.

Bulpitt, 2000\\u2029http://www.cdc.gov/bloodpressure/ Influenza caused by a new subtype Background\\ufdd0An influenza pandemic occurs when a new influenza A virus emerges with efficient and sustained human-to-human transmission in populations with limited immunity. Influenza pandemics occurred in 1918, 1957 and 1968; 2009. The 1918 pandemic killed an estimated 40–50 million people. It is predicted that a pandemic of equivalent magnitude could kill 62 million people, 96% of them in developing countries.\\u2029Influenza caused by new subtype were reported in i) 1997/human infections with the A(H5N1) virus HPAI; ii) 2009/Influenza A (H1N1) pandemic; iii) 2013/human infections with A(H7N9) virus. Other avian influenza viruses have resulted in sporadic human infections including the A(H7N7) and A(H9N2) viruses. Some countries have also reported sporadic human infections with swine influenza viruses, particularly the A(H1) and A(H3) subtypes.\\u2029\\u2029Successful mitigation or control of pandemic influenza is dependent on early recognition of sustained human-to-human transmission of a new influenza A virus. Countries have been encouraged as part of pandemic preparedness planning to enhance surveillance to (i) detect the emergence of new disease; (ii) characterize the disease (epidemiology, clinical manifestations, severity); and (iii) monitor its evolution and start control measures.\\u2029Under the IHR (2005), a State Party is to immediately notify WHO of any laboratory confirmed case of a recent human infection caused by an influenza A virus with the potential to cause a pandemic. Evidence of illness is not required for this report.\\ufdd0Surveillance goals\\ufdd0To detect and investigate the first evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission of an influenza virus with pandemic potential.\\u2029To assess the earliest cases of pandemic influenza occurring in a country in order to characterize the new disease including its clinical characteristics, risk factor information, and epidemiological and virological features.\\u2029To monitor the course of the pandemic within the country, regionally and globally.\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Standard case definitions: Influenza caused by a new subtype\\u20291-For infections with other non-seasonal influenza viruses, case definitions must be adapted to the situation.

The energy causing the injury can be mechanical, electrical, thermal, radiant or chemical. Injury is classified as intentional and unintentional.\\u2029All injuries account for 10% of the world’s deaths. 5.8 million People die each year as a result of different types of injuries. Of the all systems that people have to deal with on a daily basis; road transport is the most complex and the most dangerous.\\u2029Road traffic accidents result in unintentional injury.\\u2029A traffic collision (motor vehicle collision, motor vehicle accident, car accident, or car crash) occurs when a road vehicle collides with another vehicle, pedestrian, animal, road debris, or other geographical or architectural obstacle. Traffic collisions can result in injury, property damage, and death.\\u2029Worldwide, the number of people killed in road traffic crashes each year is estimated at 1.2 million, while the number of injured could be as high as 50 million.\\u2029Road traffic injuries are a major but neglected global public health problem, requiring concerted efforts for effective and sustainable prevention.\\u2029Road traffic injuries continue to be among the leading causes of death and disability among young people aged between 5 and 44 years and the leading cause of death in the category of people between 15-29 years. The majority of such deaths are currently among “vulnerable road users”-pedestrians, pedal cyclists and motorcyclists.\\u2029Without increased efforts and new initiatives, the total number of road traffic deaths worldwide and injuries is forecast to rise by some 67% by 2020, and in low income and middle-income countries deaths are expected to increase by as much as 83%\\u2029The African region has the highest fatality rate for road traffic crashes at 32/100 000 population\\u2029Road traffic injuries are preventable.

Mauritania reports a few cases each year and South Africa reported 165 laboratory-confirmed cases between 1981 and March 2006.\\u2029Lassa fever is known to be endemic in Guinea, Liberia, Nigeria and Sierra Leone, but probably exists in other West African countries as well. Some studies indicate that 300,000 to 500,000 Lassa fever cases with 5,000 deaths occur each year in West Africa.\\u2029CCHF spreads to humans either by tick-bites, or through contact with viraemic animal tissue immediately post-slaughter.\\u2029The animal reservoir of the Lassa virus is a rodent of the genus Mastomys. Mastomys infected with Lassa virus do not become ill but shed the virus in their excreta (urine and faeces) and humans usually become infected through aerosol or direct contact with excreta of infected rodents. Lassa fever can also be spread between humans through direct contact with the blood, pharyngeal secretions, urine, faeces or other body secretions of an infected person.\\u2029Person-to-person transmission of both CCHF and Lassa fever viruses has occurred in health care settings after exposure to blood and secretions of infected patients.\\u2029The incubation period for CCHF following a tick bite is usually 1-3 days (maximum 9 days) and following contact with blood or tissues is usually 5-6 days (maximum 13 days). The incubation period for Lassa fever ranges from 6-21 days.\\u2029The onset of symptoms among CCHF patients is sudden with fever, myalgia and other signs and symptoms. The reported case fatality ratio for CCHF is between 3% and 30%.\\u2029About 80% of human Lassa fever infections are mild or asymptomatic; the remaining cases have severe multi-system disease. The onset of disease in symptomatic patients is usually gradual starting with fever, general weakness and malaise. Lassa fever is difficult to distinguish from many other diseases which cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, yellow fever and other VHFs. The overall case fatality ratio ranges from 1 to 15% among hospitalized patients.\\u2029General supportive therapy is the mainstay of patient management in CCHF. Intensive monitoring to guide volume and blood component replacement is required. The antiviral drug, ribavirin, has been used in the treatment of established CCHF infection. Both oral and intravenous formulations seem to be effective. Ribavirin is effective treatment for Lassa fever is given early in the course of clinical illness.\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Surveillance goal : Lassa and Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fevers\\ufdd0Early detection of cases and outbreaks, rapid investigation, and early laboratory verification of the aetiology of all suspected cases.\\u2029Investigation of all suspected cases with contact tracing.\\u2029Assess and monitor the spread and progress of epidemics and the effectiveness of control measures.\\ufdd0Standard case definitions\\ufdd0Suspected case of CCHF: Illness with sudden onset of fever, malaise, weakness, irritability, headache, severe pain in limbs and loins and marked anorexia.

The disease is transmitted mainly through airborne spread from nasal secretions of patients infected by Hansen’s bacillus (Mycobacterium leprae) and also through inoculation into broken skin. Leprosy is endemic in several tropical areas around the world, including Africa.\\u2029Patients are classified into two groups, depending on presence of skin and nerve signs:\\u2029Multibacillary patients (MB) with more than 5 skin patches and several nerve enlargements.\\u2029Paucibacillary patients (PB) with one to five skin patches and a single nerve enlargement.\\u2029Leprosy control has improved greatly through use of WHO recommended multidrug therapy (MDT). MDT combining two or three drugs (rifampicin, clofaximine and dapsone) is very effective in curing leprosy. At the end of 1999, leprosy point prevalence in African countries was 1.6 cases per 10 000 population with about 70 000 registered cases. Seventeen years later, at the end of 2016, this prevalnec rate was reduced to 0.25 cases per 10 000 population and les than 25 000 registered cases \\u2029Incubation period is 6 months to 20 years or more. Infection is probably frequent but clinical disease is rare, even among the closest contacts of patients. Multibacillary patients are most contagious, but infectiousness is reduced rapidly as soon as multiple drug therapy begins. Leprosy can be complicated by neuritis and leprosy reactions, resulting in impairment and disabilities of hands, feet, and eyes.\\u2029Leprosy has historically been associated with social isolation and psychosocial consequences. This social stigma still persists in some countries in Africa.\\u2029Some skin diseases such as tinea versicolor, mycosis, vitiligo, Scleroderma, psoriasis, systemic lupus erythematosus and Von Recklinghausen disease may be mistaken for leprosy.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Observe national trends towards the leprosy elimination target, defined as a reduction in prevalence to less than 1 new case with grade-2 disabilities per 1 000 000 population.\\u2029Monitor resistance of Hansen’s bacillus to drugs used for MTD on an ongoing basis.\\u2029As leprosy nears elimination, supplement routine surveillance with community-based surveillance, including active case search among household contacts of leprosy patients, especially during mass medicine administration or immunization campaigns.\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case:\\u2029A person showing one of three cardinal signs of leprosy: hypo-pigmented or reddish skin lesion, loss or decrease of sensations in skin patch, enlargement or peripheral nerve.\\u2029Confirmed case: A person showing at least two cardinal signs of leprosy and who has not completed a full course of treatment with multidrug therapy (MDT).\\ufdd0Respond to alert threshold: Leprosy \\ufdd0If a single case is suspected:\\u2029Report the suspected case to the appropriate level of the health system.\\u2029Investigate case for risk factors.\\u2029Begin appropriate case management:\\u2029--MB patients must be treated for 12 months with a three-drug regimen (12 MB blister packs to be taken in a period of 18 months).\\u2029--PB patients must be treated for 6 months with a two drugs MDT regimen ( 6 PB blister packs to be taken in a period of 9 months)\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0If a suspected case is confirmed:\\u2029Examine patients for skin and nerve signs at each contact patient has with a health worker to diagnose and care for leprosy reactions and impairments.\\u2029Examine risk factors for treatment interruption (for example, inadequate supplies of MDT in the health centre, poor accessibility of patients’ villages, and so on).

It affects over 120 million persons in 80 countries, and over 40 million persons are seriously incapacitated by the disease; 20% of the world population is at risk of infection. Of those infected, roughly 1/3 are in India, 1/3 in Africa, and the rest in the Americas, Asia, and the Pacific. In 1997, resolution WHA50.29 called for the elimination of lymphatic filariasis as a global public health problem. The strategy adopted is based on:\\u2029Reducing transmission below a threshold where new infection ceases to occur\\u2029Treatment of the problems associated with disability control and prevention.\\u2029Causal agents:in Africa only the filariae Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi, and Brugia timori\\u2029Modes of transmission: transmitted by various species of mosquitoes, these parasitic filarial worms lodge in the human lymphatic system, producing millions of immature microfilariae that circulate in the blood. Microfilariae appear in the peripheral blood after 3 to 6 months for Brugia malayi, 6 to 12 months for W bancrofti, often with nocturnal periodicity. When a mosquito thereafter bites the infected person, the microfilariae are picked up and the infection may be transmitted to others after about 2 weeks.\\u2029Clinical description:\\u2029Filarial infection may be clinically asymptomatic (even in the presence of laboratory evidence of lymphatic and kidney damage); the disease may also present as one or more acute manifestations (fever, local swellings, tropical pulmonary eosinophilia syndrome, lymphangitis).\\u2029Chronic complications include:\\u2029Lymphoedema or elephantiasis of the limbs\\u2029Damage to the genital organs (including hydrocoele in men)\\u2029Damage to the kidney (including chyluria) and lymphatic system.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0There are currently 3 options and the choice will depend on the local situation:\\u2029Routine monthly reporting of aggregated data on probable and confirmed cases from periphery to intermediate level and to central level\\u2029Sentinel population surveys (standardized and periodical),\\u2029Active case-finding through surveys of selected groups or through mass surveys. International: Annual reporting from central level to WHO (for a limited number of countries).\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case:\\u2029Resident of an endemic area with a clinical sign of hydrocoele or lymphoedema for which other causes of these findings have been excluded.\\u2029Confirmed case:\\u2029A person with positive laboratory diagnosis of microfilaremia in blood smear, filarial antigenaemia or positive ultrasound test.\\ufdd0Respond to alert threshold: Lymphatic Filariasis\\ufdd0Confirm community prevalence of infection by surveys\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0Case management\\u2029Hygiene measures for the affected body parts (and, when necessary, antibiotics and antifungal agents) can decrease the risk of adenolymphangitis:\\u2029Washing the affected parts twice daily with soap and water\\u2029Raising the affected limb at night\\u2029Exercising to promote lymph flow\\u2029Keeping nails short and clean\\u2029Wearing comfortable footwear\\u2029Using antiseptic or antibiotic creams to treat small wounds or abrasions, or in severe cases systemic antibiotics.\\u2029For the treatment of filarial carriers, the regimen recommended by the country is to be followed:\\u2029In areas where there is neither onchocerciasis nor loiasis: DEC 6 mg/kg single dose.\\u2029In areas where Onchocerciasis has been excluded but not loiasis: individual clinical decision.\\u2029The current strategy for filariasis control rests essentially on anti-parasitic measures. To interrupt transmission, the entire at risk population must be given a yearly, 1-dose regimen of the following:\\u2029Areas with concurrent onchocerciasis:\\u2029400 mg of albendazole + ivermectin 150 mg per kg of body weight once a year for 4-6 years\\u2029Areas with no concurrent Onchocerciasis\\u2029Diethylcarbamazine 6 milligrams per kg of body weight + albendazole 400 mg once a year, or\\u2029Diethylcarbamazine fortified salt for daily use for at least 6-12 months.\\u2029NOTE: In areas with concurrent loiasis (sub-Saharan Africa rain forest), mass interventions cannot at present be envisaged systematically (unless Onchocerciasis is a severe public health problem), because of the risk of severe adverse reactions in patients with high-density Loa infections (about 1 in 10,000 treatments).\\u2029It is important to educate the population on the importance of compliance during mass chemotherapy.

Five parasite species cause malaria in humans, namely: Plasmodium falciparum (the most common), P. ovale, P. vivax, P. malariae and P. knowlesi. Serious malarial infections are usually due to P. falciparum which may result in severe disease.\\u2029\\u2029Malaria is one of the leading causes of illness and death in many African countries. In most parts of Africa malaria transmission is highly seasonal. In areas of high transmission in Africa malaria is mainly a disease of children less than 5 years old and pregnant women. However, some countries have witnessed a dramatic reduction of malaria transmission and in such countries malaria has become a disease of all age groups and malaria epidemics are likely to occur.\\u2029\\u2029The incubation period from the time of being bitten to onset of symptoms is approximately 10 to 14 days. The incubation period may be longer, with non- P. falciparum species. \\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Detect malaria cases promptly in areas of high transmission and to detect epidemics promptly in epidemic prone areas or in areas with a large population at risk.\\ufdd0Standard case definition: Malaria\\ufdd0Uncomplicated malaria: Uncomplicated P. falciparum malaria is highly variable and mimics that of many other diseases. Although fever is common, it is often intermittent and may even be absent in some cases. The fever is typically irregular initially and commonly associated with chills. Rigors are unusual in acute falciparum malaria. The patient commonly complains of fever, headache, aches and pains elsewhere in the body and occasionally abdominal pain and diarrhoea. In a young child, there may be irritability, refusal to eat and vomiting. On physical examination, fever may be the only sign. In some patients, the liver and spleen are palpable. This clinical presentation is usually indistinguishable clinically from those of influenza and a variety of other common causes of fever. Unless the condition is diagnosed and treated promptly, a patient with falciparum malaria may deteriorate rapidly. Therefore, any person living in an area at risk of malaria with fever or history of fever within the previous 24 hours; without signs of severe malaria, who tests positive for malaria by either rapid diagnostic test or microscopy should be considered a case of uncomplicated malaria (NB WHO presently recommends that all malaria cases should be confirmed by RDT or microscopy).\\u2029\\u2029Severe malaria: Severe malaria is defined by clinical or laboratory evidence of vital organ dysfunction. Nearly all deaths from severe malaria result from infections with P. falciparum. Strict definitions of severe malaria have been published for epidemiological and research purposes, but, in practice, there should be a low threshold for starting parenteral treatment in any patient about whom a health care worker is concerned. Even if some of the laboratory measures are not available immediately, this should not delay the start of intensive treatment. A general overview of the features of severe malaria include: \\u2029impaired consciousness (including unarousable coma);\\u2029prostration, i.e. generalized weakness so that the patient is unable to sit, stand or walk without assistance;\\u2029multiple convulsions: more than two episodes within 24h;\\u2029deep breathing and respiratory distress (acidotic breathing);\\u2029acute pulmonary oedema and acute respiratory distress syndrome;\\u2029circulatory collapse or shock, systolic blood pressure\\u2029< 80mm Hg in adults and < 50mm Hg in children;\\u2029acute kidney injury;\\u2029 clinical jaundice plus evidence of other vital organ dysfunction; and abnormal bleeding\\u2029Note: These manifestations can occur singly or, more commonly, in combination in the same patient.\\u2029\\u2029Any patient hospitalized with P. falciparum asexual parasitaemia as confirmed by laboratory tests with accompanying symptoms and signs of severe disease (vital organ dysfunction) diagnosed through laboratory.\\ufdd0Respond to alert threshold: Malaria\\ufdd0If there is an unusual increase in the number of malaria cases or deaths as compared to the same period in previous non-epidemic years:\\u2029Report suspected epidemic to the next level,\\u2029Treat with appropriate anti-malarial drugs according to national treatment guidelines\\u2029Investigate the cause for the increase in cases\\u2029Make sure cases in children age 2 months up to 5 years are managed according to IMCI guidelines.\\u2029Conduct community education for prompt detection of cases and access to health facilities.\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0If the number of cases exceeds the upper limit of cases seen in a previous non-epidemic period in previous years:\\u2029Evaluate and improve, as needed, prevention strategies, such as use of insecticide treated nets (ITNs) and indoor residential spraying (IRS) for all at risk of malaria.\\u2029Ensure appropriate case management\\u2029Ensure adequate supplies and drugs are available in the health facilities\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time: Graph the number of cases by month/week.

Note: Setting an epidemic threshold: In areas with endemic malaria, the national Malaria Control Program can assist districts and health centres with determining appropriate thresholds for detecting possible epidemics. In the absence of a threshold set by the national program, the following method can be used to determine the threshold level for a malaria epidemic. The threshold is determined using the median and the 3rd quartile of a period of time (for example, 5-year data from a health facility or district by month/week): Look at the number of malaria cases at a specific health facility or district by month/week for the past 5 years. Determine the median for each month/week (for example, each January for the last 5 years). Rank the monthly/weekly data for each month/week for the five years in ascending order. Identify the number in the middle of each month’s/week’s series for the five years. This is the median. Repeat this process for each month/week in the five years. Determine the 3rd quartile for the monthly/weekly series by identifying the 4th highest number from the bottom in each data series (since data is ranked in ascending order). This is the 3rd quartile representing the upper limit of the expected normal number of malaria cases. Plot the 3rd Quartile for each data series by month/week for the five year period and join the points with a line. The line represents the upper limit of the expected number of cases. Plot the median for each data series by month/week for the five year period and join the points with a line. This line represents the lowest limit of expected number of cases. The area between the two lines (the median and the 3rd quartile) represents the “normal channel”. If the number of currently observed cases of malaria falls between the two lines, the number of new cases for that month/week is assumed to be “normal”. If the number is above the 3rd quartile (upper limit), this is an indication of a possible malaria epidemic. Note: Please note that to ensure early detection and control of malaria epidemics; it is preferable to use weekly surveillance data in Malaria epidemic prone areas. In areas in malaria pre-elimination or elimination phases a single case of locally transmitted malaria should lead to proactive interventions, including active case search in the locality where the case originated.

Of the 40 countries with a child stunting prevalence of 40% or more, 23 are in Africa.\\u2029Severe malnutrition may act as a direct cause of death or an indirect cause by increasing dramatically the number of deaths in children suffering from common childhood illnesses such as diarrhoea and pneumonia.\\u2029Despite the above, the burden of child mortality due to severe malnutrition remains largely absent from the international health agenda and few countries, even in high prevalence areas, have specific national policies aimed at addressing it comprehensively.\\u2029The most vulnerable are children under five and pregnant and lactating women. The poor nutritional status and nutritional intake of pregnant women may contribute to newborns with low birth weight (a weight measured immediately after birth). A newborn weighing less than 2500 grams (2.5 kg or 5.5 Ib) is considered a newborn with low birth weight (LBW). LBW is a major determinant of death, illness and disability in infancy and childhood and also impacts health outcomes in adult life.\\u2029Socio-economic conditions, poor water and sanitation, mothers’ nutritional education on how to feed babies and young children, and repeated infections are the main causes of malnutrition.\\u2029Programmes elaborated to eradicate malnutrition are on food security, water and sanitation, promotion of infant and young children feeding practices, micronutrient supplementation programmes, management of severe cases of malnutrition in the communities and in the health facilities, management of infections mainly diarrhoeal disease.\\u2029Many sporadic surveys are being organized, but nutrition surveillance is currently poorly implemented and does not allow for interventions related to prevention and management of malnutrition.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Early warning and problem identification.\\u2029Policy-making and planning.\\u2029Programme management and evaluation.\\u2029Assess effectiveness of public health response that address causes of low birth weight, malnutrition in children and malnutrition in pregnant women Standard case definition: Malnutrition\\ufdd0Low birth weight new-borns:\\u2029Any new born with a birth weight less than 2500 g (or 5.5 lbs) \\u2029Malnutrition in children:\\u2029-Children under five who are underweight (indicator: weight for age<-2 ZScore)\\u2029-Children 6 to 59 months with mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) <11.5 cm (high risk of \\u2029mortality)\\u2029-Bilateral pitting oedema\\u2029Malnutrition in pregnant women:\\u2029Pregnant women given birth to low birth weight babies (birth weight < 2.5 Kg) (poor nutritional and health status of the women, can predict which population groups may benefit from improved antenatal care of women and neonatal care for infants).\\ufdd0Response to alert threshold\\ufdd0If more than 20% of children are underweight: Programme emphasis on\\u2029Breastfeeding support\\u2029Nutrition education\\u2029Supplementation of child and mother\\u2029Prevention and treatment of diarrhoea\\u2029Prevention and treatment of severe malnutrition\\u2029Socio-economic support\\u2029As soon as one case with MUAC less than 11.5 cm is detected or presence of bilateral oedema identified: Alert, further investigation should be conducted.

(NB. Those due to accidental or incidental causes are not considered as maternal deaths)\\u2029Globally, about 80% of maternal deaths are due to; severe bleeding (mostly bleeding postpartum), infections (also mostly soon after delivery), hypertensive disorders in pregnancy (eclampsia) and obstructed labor. Complications after unsafe abortion cause 13% of maternal deaths.\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029Across the developing world, maternal mortality levels remain too high, with more than 500,000 women dying every year as a result of complications during pregnancy and childbirth. About half of these deaths occur in sub-Saharan Africa where a woman’s lifetime risk of maternal death is 1 in 22, compared with 1 in 8,000 in industrialized countries.\\u2029\\u2029Haemorrhage is the leading cause of maternal death in sub-Saharan Africa, and unattended births are a particular risk, especially in rural areas where transport to health care facilities is a problem.\\u2029Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) reporting in 2030 demands active surveillance, and counting of maternal deaths. The report is no longer proportionate as was in the Millenium Development Goals (MDGs) (reduce by 75%), Rather countries will report pegged on an actual number - in that no country should have a maternal mortality ratio (MMR) >70 deaths/ 100 000 live births\\u2029Review of progress towards MDG 5 indicates that most African countries were not able to meet MDG by 2015.

Pneumonia is common, but not always present. Gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhoea, have also been reported. Some laboratory-confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection are reported as asymptomatic, meaning that they do not have any clinical symptoms, yet they are positive for MERS following a laboratory test. Most of these asymptomatic cases have been detected following aggressive contact tracing of a laboratory-confirmed case.\\u2029Approximately 35% of reported patients with MERS have died.\\u2029Dromedary camels are the major reservoir host for MERS-CoV and humans are infected from direct or indirect unprotected contact with infected dromedary camels. However, the exact role of dromedaries in transmission of the virus and the exact route(s) of transmission are unknown.\\u2029The virus does not seem to pass easily from person to person unless there is close unprotected contact, such as occurs when providing care to a patient. Health care associated outbreaks have occurred in several countries, with the largest outbreaks seen in Saudi Arabia, United Arab Emirates, and the Republic of Korea. \\u2029Approximately half of human cases of MERS have been attributed to human-to-human infections in health care settings.\\u2029\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Surveillance Goal\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0To detect early cases of MERS-CoV infection and any evidence of sustained human-to-human transmission\\u2029To determine the geographic risk areas for infection with the virus\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/technical-guidance-surveillance/en/\\u2029The following people should be investigated and tested for MERS-CoV (From: Surveillance for human infection with Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS -

The presence of viral nucleic acid can be confirmed by either positive results for nucleic acid amplification assays, such as reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), for at least two specific genomic targets or a single positive target with sequencing of a second target. A case confirmed by serology requires demonstration of sero-conversion in 2 samples ideally taken at least 14 days apart, by a screening (ELISA, IFA) and a neutralization assay. However, the interim recommendations for laboratory testing for MERS-CoV should be consulted for the most recent standard for laboratory confirmation (http://www.who.int/csr/disease/coronavirus_infections/en/)\\u20292 A direct epidemiological link with a confirmed MERS-CoV patient may include:\\u2029Health care associated exposure, including providing direct care for MERS-CoV patients, working with health care workers infected with MERS-CoV, visiting patients or staying in the same close environment of a individuals infected with MERS-CoV. \\u2029Working together in close proximity or sharing the same environment with individuals infected with MERS-CoV. \\u2029Traveling together with individuals infected with MERS-CoV in any kind of conveyance \\u2029Living in the same household as individuals infected with MERS-CoV. \\u2029The epidemiological link may have occurred within a 14-day period before or after the onset of illness in the case under consideration. \\u20293 An inadequate specimen would include a nasopharyngeal swab without an accompanying lower respiratory specimen, a specimen that has had improper handling, is judged to be of poor quality by the testing laboratory, or was taken too late in the course of illness.\\u20294 Inconclusive tests may include: \\u2029A positive test by nucleic acid amplification assay for a single target without further  testing.\\u2029Evidence of sero-reactivity by a single convalescent serum sample ideally taken at least 14 days after exposure by a screening assay (ELISA or IFA) and a neutralization assay, in the absence of molecular confirmation from respiratory specimens. \\u2029Inconclusive testing: Patients with an inconclusive initial testing should undergo additional virologic and serologic testing to determine if the patient can be classified as a confirmed MERS case. It is strongly advised that multiple lower respiratory tract specimens such as sputum, endotracheal aspirate, or bronchoalveolar lavage fluid be collected and tested when possible. If patients do not have signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract disease and lower tract specimens are not available or clinically indicated, both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab specimens should be collected. If initial testing of a nasopharyngeal swab is negative in a patient who is strongly suspected to have MERS-CoV infection, patients should be retested using a lower respiratory specimen tract or a repeat nasopharyngeal specimen with additional oropharyngeal specimen if lower respiratory tract specimens are not possible, and appropriately timed paired acute and convalescent sera. Other types of clinical specimens could also be considered for molecular testing if necessary, including blood/serum, urine and stool.

It is usually a self-limiting disease but the case-fatality rate can be up to 10%, particularly among children.\\u2029Monkeypox primarily occurs in the rain forests in West and Central Africa. The primary animal reservoir is unknown but it has been detected in a range of small mammal species, particularly rodents, and monkeys. Animal species in which evidence of monkeypox virus has been found include C. gambianus (Gambian pouched rat), different squirrel species of the genus Funisciurus and Heliosciurus, G. kelleni (African dormice) and various species of non-human primates. \\u2029Communities living in the West and Central African rainforest regions need to be educated about avoiding direct contact with animals, especially wild species. Efforts to prevent transmission in endemic regions should focus on thoroughly cooking all animal products (blood, meat) before eating.\\u2029Human-to-human transmission is limited (no evidence that this mode of transmission alone can sustain monkeypox in human populations) and occurs via prolonged contact with respiratory droplets and contact with lesions or bodily fluids that contain the virus. Household members and health care workers are at highest risk during an outbreak.\\u2029Monkeypox is an emerging disease which has become the most prevalent orthopoxvirus since the global eradication of smallpox that was declared by the World Health Assembly in 1980. This is partly because smallpox vaccination which was cross-protective for other orthopoxviruses was discontinued at the time which means younger people no longer have vaccine-induced immunity.\\u2029Human monkeypox was first identified in humans in 1970 in the Democratic Republic of Congo which remains the country that routinely reports the highest number of cases (>1,000) annually since 2005. Other countries that have reported human cases since 1970 include Sierra Leone, Liberia, Cote d’Ivoire, Nigeria, Cameroon, Gabon, Republic of Congo, Central African Republic and Sudan (in an area that is now South Sudan). Since late 2016 there have been increasing reports of monkeypox cases from countries that have not seen any for the past 40 years.\\u2029Clinical recognition, particularly differential diagnosis with other rash and fever illnesses such as chickenpox, laboratory-based diagnosis and prevention remain critical challenges in endemic areas. Two distinct clades or subtypes have been identified. It is believed that infection with a West African strain of monkeypox virus causes a less severe infection, fewer deaths, and lower rates of human-to-human transmission as compared to outbreaks involving Central African strains.\\u2029The incubation period of monkeypox is 6-16 days (range 5–21). The infection can be divided into two periods: (1) invasion period (0-5 days) characterized by fever, intense headache, lymphadenopathy (swelling of the lymph node), back pain, myalgia (muscle ache) and an intense asthenia (lack of energy); and (2) skin eruption period (1-3 days after appearance of fever) where the various stages of the rash appears, often beginning on the face and then spreading elsewhere on the body.\\u2029The most distinguishing symptom of monkeypox is lymphadenopathy. The face (in 95% of cases), and palms of the hands and soles of the feet (75%) are most affected by the rash. Evolution of the rash from maculo-papules (lesions with a flat bases) to vesicles (small fluid-filled blisters), pustules, followed by crusts occurs in approximately 10 days. Three weeks might be necessary before the complete disappearance of the crusts. \\u2029Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with monkeypox but can be distinguished from monkeypox and smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication. Coinfection with both, varicella and monkeypox virus, has been reported. However the frequency of this phenomenon, relationship and impact between the viruses’ pathogenesis and epidemiology is not clear.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0To detect and immediately respond to any suspected case of monkeypox.\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case: An acute illness with fever > 38.3 C (101 F), intense headache, lymphadenopathy, back pain, myalgia, and intense asthenia followed one to three days later by a progressively developing rash often beginning on the face (most dense) and then spreading elsewhere on the body, including soles of feet and palms of hand.\\u2029Probable case: A case that meets the clinical case definition, is not laboratory confirmed, but has an epidemiological link to a confirmed or probable case.\\u2029Confirmed case: A clinically compatible case that is laboratory confirmed.\\u2029Differential diagnosis: Alternative causes of clinical symptoms that must be considered include other rash illnesses, such as, smallpox, chickenpox, measles, bacterial skin infections, scabies, syphilis, and medication-associated allergies.

It is caused by a retrovirus, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Sexual intercourse, needle injections, transfusions, trans-placental or trans-vaginal routes, breast milk or other direct contact with infected human body fluids transmits the virus from human to human.\\u2029Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) results in late-stage HIV infection and immuno-suppression, with reduced numbers and function to T-lymphocytes. Primary HIV-related organ involvement and a variety of opportunistic infections result in death unless the growth of the virus is stopped by drugs that can kill the virus (antiretroviral therapy). When HIV infection progresses to illness, the symptoms are usually due to the failure of the immune system to resist other infectious diseases called opportunistic infections (OI). These include tuberculosis, bacterial pneumonia or sepsis, oro-pharyngeal candidiasis, chronic diarrhoea, chronic skin infections, recurrent herpes zoster, and others.\\u2029Close to twenty-six million Africans, close to one in ten adults between the ages of 15 and 49 years of age, are living with HIV/AIDS. The impact of the epidemic is already measurable in greatly increased adult and child morbidity and mortality. HIV/AIDS is now the leading cause of adult mortality in the African Region.\\u2029Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months from the time of infection to the time that antibodies can be detected in a laboratory process. The time from HIV infection to the onset of AIDS is generally 7 to 9 years.\\u2029Risk factors: populations at high risk of acquiring HIV are commercial sex workers with or without other sexually transmitted infections (STIs). Some STIs may increase HIV transmission. Others at risk include intravenous drug users (IDU), recipients of unscreened blood products and neonates born to HIV-infected mothers.\\u2029Tuberculosis, visceral leishmaniasis, trypanosomiasis, and other subacute or chronic bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Monitor the impact of HIV/AIDS interventions in trends of incidence and prevalence of HIV infections, AIDS and STIs through sentinel sites, surveys and special studies (according to guidelines for second generation surveillance of HIV/AIDS).\\u2029Estimate the burden of HIV/AIDS in the district using available information from HIV sentinel populations so that each new AIDS case is counted.\\u2029Monitor local STI epidemiology as possible cofactor for HIV transmission.\\u2029Monitor local opportunistic infection epidemiology, including TB\\u2029Improve percentage of suspected HIV/AIDS cases confirmed via serology.\\u2029Improve HIV/AIDS screening.\\ufdd0Standard case definition: New HIV/AIDS Cases\\ufdd0WHO/AFRO recommends that countries use either Bangui or Abidjan HIV/AIDS case definitions.

Diseases that commonly precede noma include measles, malaria, severe diarrhea, and necrotizing ulcerative gingivitis.\\u2029Noma occurs worldwide, but is most common in sub-Saharan Africa. In 1998, WHO estimated that worldwide 140 000 children contract noma each year, and 79% of them die from the disease and associated complications.\\u2029In Africa the highest prevalence of Noma occurs in countries bordering the Sahara desert, where a recent report estimates an annual incidence of 25,000. However, Noma can occur wherever there is extreme poverty.\\u2029Early detection and treatment with antibiotics is key to preventing severe disfigurement or death.

WHO/CDS/CSR/ISR/99.2\\u2029 Perinatal (Stillbirths and Neonatal) Deaths Background\\ufdd0The Global Strategy for Women’s and Children’s and Adolescents’ Health with its three objectives of Survive, Thrive and Transform sets targets for the coming 15 years which Member States have agreed and committed to achieve. This includes reducing neonatal mortality to less than 12 deaths per 1,000 births and stillbirths to less than 12 per 1,000 total births, in line with the multi-stakeholders’ action plan “Every Newborn: an action plan to end preventable deaths” (ENAP), which encompasses two goals:  ending preventable newborn deaths and stillbirths.  \\u2029\\u2029Globally there are 2.7 million neonatal deaths annually, of these 1 million take place in the African Region. Three main causes of neonatal deaths make up about 80% of the deaths: birth asphyxia, prematurity and neonatal infections. Equally, there are about 2.6 million annual stillbirths globally, of which 98 percent occur in developing countries.  About half of all stillbirths occur in the intrapartum period, representing the greatest time of risk. Causes of stillbirths may be a consequence of maternal conditions and diseases like pre-eclampsia, obesity, diabetes, malaria, syphilis and HIV. There are however no available global estimates on causes of stillbirths. \\u2029 \\u2029The reduction of neonatal mortality reached 38% in the African Region during the MDG era. However, the reduction has been much slower than that of the under-5 mortality of 54%. Achieving the set SDG target for the reduction of both stillbirths and neonatal deaths will require up to a seven-fold reduction of the current neonatal and stillbirth mortality rates in the African Region. This will require addressing current challenges for the efficient delivery of high quality services for mothers and newborns, but also efforts of strengthening the health information systems to understand the real number of deaths and the causes of deaths. \\u2029\\u2029One of the biggest challenge in addressing both stillbirths and neonatal deaths is lack of information on the correct numbers and causes of deaths.  Yet majority of the stillbirths and neonatal deaths can be prevented with clearly targeted quality interventions by appropriately skilled health workers. Addressing these gaps calls for investing birth and death registration through surveillance and response, linking with perinatal review and taking action.\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\u2029\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0The primary goal is to eliminate preventable stillbirths and neonatal deaths by: \\u2029Counting every stillbirths and neonatal death through an active identification and reporting at community and facility levels to permit an assessment of the true magnitude of stillbirths and neonatal mortality and the impact of actions to reduce them;\\u2029Identifying underlying causes, contributing factors and high risk areas for stillbirths and neonatal deaths to effectively guides immediate as well as longer term actions and to inform program decisions to reduce these deaths \\u2029 Standard case definitions: Perinatal (Stillbirths and Neonatal) Deaths\\ufdd0Perinatal death includes the death of a baby of at least 28 weeks of gestation and/or 1,000 g in weight and early neonatal death (the first seven days after birth)\\u2029\\u2029A stillbirth is defined as any death of a baby before birth and with no signs of life at birth of at least 1,000 g birthweight and/or at least 28 weeks gestation and 35 cm long.\\u2029 \\u2029Early neonatal death is defined as any death of a live newborn occurring before the first 7 complete days of life.

WHO/EPI 2007 Rabies (Human) Background\\ufdd0Rabies is a zoonotic disease (a disease that is transmitted to humans from animals) that is caused by a virus. Rabies infects domestic and wild animals, and is spread to people through close contact with infected saliva (via bites or scratches).\\u2029The rabies virus infects the central nervous system, causing disease in the brain and, eventually, death. Early symptoms in people include: fever, headache, and general weakness or discomfort. As the disease\\u2029progresses,symptomsinclude;insomnia,anxiety,confusion,slightorpartialparalysis,excitable behaviour, hallucinations, increase in saliva, difficulty swallowing, and fear of water.\\u2029In unvaccinated humans, rabies is almost always fatal if post-exposure prophylaxis is not administered before the onset of severe symptoms. Death usually occurs within days of the onset of neurological symptoms.\\u2029Dogs are the main carrier of rabies in Africa and are responsible for most (approximately 97%) of the human rabies deaths worldwide.\\u2029WHO estimates approximately 55,000 human deaths worldwide due to rabies each year; in Africa the annual death toll is 24,000.\\u2029People most at risk of rabies live in rural areas, and children are at highest risk of dog rabies. About 30% to 60% of the victims of dog bites (the primary mode of virus transmission) are children less than 15 years of age. Children often play with animals and are less likely to report bites or scratches.\\u2029Control of rabies in dog populations and access to human rabies post exposure prophylaxis can substantially reduce the burden of rabies in human populations\\u2029Rapid and accurate laboratory diagnosis of rabies in humans and other animals is essential for timely administration of post-exposure prophylaxis. Within a few hours, a diagnostic laboratory can determine whether or not an animal is rabid and inform the responsible medical personnel.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Detect and respond promptly and appropriately to cases and outbreaks of rabies.\\u2029Identify high-risk areas\\u2029Estimation of disease burden\\u2029Immediate reporting of cases and routine monthly summary reports\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected\\u2029A person with one or more of the following: headache, neck pain, nausea, fever, fear of water, anxiety, agitation, abnormal tingling sensations or pain at the wound site, when contact with a rabid animal is suspected.\\u2029Confirmed\\u2029A suspected case that is laboratory confirmed\\ufdd0Recommended Public Health Action: Rabies (Human)\\ufdd0For a single case:\\u2029Post exposure prophylaxis to prevent rabies\\u2029Isolate patient if rabies develops to prevent infection of others\\u2029Immunize contacts if patient develops rabies\\u2029Vaccinate local dogs and cats to prevent outbreaks\\u2029General preventive measures:\\u2029Promote public awareness of rabies\\u2029Target immunization campaign for domestic or wild animals in high-risk areas\\u2029Maintain active surveillance of rabies in animals\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time:Plot cases monthly.\\u2029Place:Plot the location of case households and animal exposures.\\u2029Person:Analyse distribution of cases by age, exposing animal, and circumstances of infection.

No test can determine whether the rabies virus has been transmitted to the person immediately after the bite. So, the animal is evaluated to determine whether the person requires treatment. A wild animal that has bitten a person is killed if possible, so that its brain can be examined.\\u2029If a person who has been bitten by an animal becomes increasingly confused and agitated or paralyzed, the diagnosis is probably rabies. At this point, tests can detect the rabies virus.\\u2029Post mortem: within 4-6hrs after death of patient, as soon as the suspected animal dies or is killed\\ufdd0How to prepare, store, and transport the specimen\\ufdd0Safety precautions in handling rabies virus should be taken to avoid infection.\\u2029Remove the head of the suspected animal, wrap head completely such that no blood is oozing out.

Principles and Practice of Infectious Diseases, 6th edition. Philadelphia: Churchill Livingstone; 2005 Rift Valley Fever (RVF) Background\\ufdd0Rift Valley Fever (RVF) is a viral disease that affects mainly animals and occasionally humans. The virus is a member of the Phlebovirus genus, one of the five genera in the family Bunyaviridae. The disease is frequently reported following heavy rainfall and floods. It was first isolated in Rift Valley Province of Kenya in 1930. The disease was reported in Kenya after the El Nino flooding of 1997/98 and more recently in 2006 to 2007. In 2007 and 2010, Tanzania and South Africa respectively were also affected. Other outbreaks have previously been reported in Somalia, Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Yemen.\\u2029RVF is mainly transmitted from animals (sheep, cattle, goats, camels) to humans through close contact with infected animals (such as handling meat and body fluids and consumption of raw milk). During established RVF outbreaks in animals, humans can also get infected through bites of infected mosquitoes and other biting insects.\\u2029The incubation period of RVF varies from 2 to 6 days. The clinical symptoms include an influenza-like illness, with sudden onset of fever, headache, myalgia and backache. These symptoms usually last from 4 to 7 days. Most of the infected people recover on their own. However, a small proportion (about 1%) get complications such as vomiting blood, nose bleeding and passing bloody stool. Other severe types of the disease are eye disease and meningo-encephalitis. Because the symptoms of Rift Valley fever are varied and non-specific, clinical diagnosis is often difficult, especially early in the course of the disease. Rift Valley fever is difficult to distinguish from other viral haemorrhagic fevers as well as many other diseases that cause fever, including malaria, shigellosis, typhoid fever, and yellow fever. \\u2029Management of RVF in humans is mainly supportive as there is no definitive treatment for RVF. Early detection and management of the disease is important. Human control of RVF is through control of the disease in animals through a sustained vaccination program and limiting human-animal contact. Use of insecticide treated nets and mosquito repellents can also reduce infections in human. In addition to human suffering and death, RVF has far reaching economic implications to the Livestock industry. In outbreak settings, the disease manifestation includes non-haemorrhagic febrile syndromes, and laboratory testing should be considered among persons with milder symptoms suggestive of viral illness.\\u2029Immediate Notification to WHO is formally required by IHR (Annex 2A) Standard case definition: Rift Valley Fever (RVF)\\ufdd0Suspected case: \\u2029A.

It is estimated, as of December 2017, that annually 290 000 to 650 000 deaths are associated with seasonal influenza. The mortality rates are particularly high among vulnerable population such as children, elderly, chronically ill patients etc.\\u2029An improved understanding of the epidemiology and seasonality of SARIs in Africa is essential for optimizing public health strategies for their prevention and control (e.g., vaccines and antivirals for prophylaxis and treatment, infection control).\\u2029The threat of SARIs due to novel organisms that have epidemic or pandemic potential warrants special precautions and preparedness. Respiratory disease events that may constitute a public health emergency of international concern1 include human influenza caused by a new subtype, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), pneumonic plague, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and novel agents that can cause large-scale SARI outbreaks with high morbidity and mortality.\\ufdd0Surveillance goals\\ufdd0To detect, in a timely manner, unusually severe morbidity and mortality caused by both known and unknown respiratory pathogens that have the potential for large-scale epidemics or pandemics.\\u2029To characterize and monitor trends in illnesses and deaths attributable to SARIs.\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0An acute respiratory infection with:\\u2029history of fever or measured fever of ≥ 38 C°;\\u2029and cough;\\u2029with onset within the last 10 days;\\u2029and requires hospitalization.\\ufdd0Respond to an alert threshold\\ufdd0Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if there is an unusual event (clusters of acute respiratory infections or of atypical respiratory infections, a cluster of deaths, for example) of respiratory infection. \\ufdd0Respond to an action threshold\\ufdd0Please refer to the WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018, if a single case of pandemic-prone acute respiratory disease is suspected.\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time: Frequency of reporting: Epidemiological and virological data collected from the sentinel sites should be analysed on a weekly basis. Graph cases and deaths weekly. Construct an epidemic curve throughout the year and describe transmission patterns and changes in the level of respiratory activity compared to the previous week(s), year(s) \\u2029Place: Cases should be mapped by geographical location; for example, by village, by home or by location in a health-care facility. Describe possible exposures.\\u2029Person: For individual SARI patients tested for influenza viruses, the minimum data to be collected and analysed for each patient, especially if a specimen is collected, is : Unique identifier (to link laboratory and epidemiological data, and for tracking patient if necessary), Sex, Age, History of fever and body temperature at presentation, Date of symptom onset, Date of hospitalization (SARI patients only), Patient outcome (death, survival), Date of specimen collection, Antiviral use for present illness at the time of specimen collection, Pregnancy status., Presence of chronic pre-existing medical illness(es) (Chronic respiratory disease, Asthma, Diabetes, Chronic cardiac disease, Chronic neurological or neuromuscular disease, Haematological disorders, HIV). Data on SARI can be aggregated by age groups to facilitate analysis and reporting. Recommended major age groupings for analysing are: 0 to <2 years, 2 to <5 years, 5 to <15 years, 15 to <50 years, 50 to <65 years, ≥ 65 years.\\u2029For the laboratory data, as a minimum, it is recommended that the following data should be collected:\\u2029• The number of samples tested for influenza during the week.\\u2029• The proportion of samples that were positive for influenza for SARI \\u2029• Types and subtypes of viruses detected during the week.\\u2029• Results from antiviral resistance testing (if applicable).\\u2029At the end, the following indicators or aggregated data should be collected and reported from each sentinel site:\\u2029The number of new SARI cases from whom specimens were collected during the week, grouped by standard age groups, and the proportion of each of these that were positive for influenza.\\u2029The total number of new SARI cases reported during the week, grouped by standard age groups (this includes cases that were not tested and/or did not have detailed data collected).\\u2029The number of total new hospital admissions reported during the week in the sentinel hospital where SARI surveillance is being conducted, ideally grouped by the recommended age groups.\\u2029The number of SARI deaths occurring in the healthcare facility sentinel site reported during the week, grouped by standard age groups.\\u2029The proportion of cases having each of the chronic pre-existing medical illnesses for influenza\\u2029 positive SARI cases, reported separately.\\u2029Further technical information on the role of laboratory can be found in the \\u2029WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014. https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/\\u2029AFRGeneric protocol for influenza sentinel surveillance: https://afro.who.int/publications/protocol-national-influenza-sentinel-surveillance \\u2029\\ufdd0Laboratory testing: Severe Acute Respiratory Infections (SARIs)\\ufdd0 1- For the influenza virus:\\u2029Specimens can be positive seven days or more after the onset of illness but ability to detect virus drops off notably after five to seven days, depending on the test used.\\u2029Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive method for detecting influenza virus and is the recommended influenza surveillance assay for most laboratories.\\u2029Virus culture is also needed on at least a subset of specimens in order to allow detailed antigenic and genetic characterization of the virus.\\u2029Antiviral resistance testing should be considered for high-risk patients if capacity exists in the laboratory in addition to taking a sample from non-high-risk patients\\u2029Further technical information on the role of laboratory can be found in the \\u2029WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014. https://www.who.int/influenza/resources/documents/influenza_surveillance_manual/en/\\u2029WHO Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza, 2011. https://www.who.int/influenza/gisrs_laboratory/manual_diagnosis_surveillance_influenza/en/\\u2029\\u20292- For others virus, and pathogens,please consult pathogens specific WHO guidances\\ufdd0References\\ufdd0WHO Global Epidemiological Surveillance Standards for Influenza, 2014. \\u2029AFR generic protocol for influenza sentinel surveillance 2015 https://afro.who.int/publications/protocol-national-influenza-sentinel-surveillance \\u2029Protocol for the investigation of acute respiratory illness outbreaks of unknown aetiology\\u2029 https://afro.who.int/publications/protocol-investigation-acute-respiratory-illness-outbreaks-unknown-etiology\\u2029WHO Fact Sheet on Seasonal Influenza, 2018\\u2029WHO protocol to investigate non-seasonal influenza and other emerging acute respiratory diseases, 2018\\u2029WHO Infection prevention and control of epidemic-and pandemic prone acute respiratory infections in health care guidelines, 2014\\u2029WHO Manual for the laboratory diagnosis and virological surveillance of influenza, 2011\\u2029WHO Operational guidance on sharing seasonal influenza viruses with WHO Collaborating Centres (CCs) under the Global Influenza Surveillance and Response System (GISRS) \\u2029WHO Operational guidance on sharing influenza viruses with human pandemic potential (IVPP) under the Pandemic Influenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework\\u2029WHO Standard guidance for the clinical management of influenza infections, expected publication in 2019\\u2029Influenza WHO health topic page: (http://www.who.int/influenza/en/) Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) Background\\ufdd0Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) was first recognized as a global threat in 2003 when international spread resulted in 8,098 SARS cases in 26 countries, with 774 deaths.\\u2029Nosocomial transmission of SARS-CoV was a striking feature of the SARS outbreak.\\u2029The majority of the cases were adults.

World Health Organization. WHO/CDR/95.14.1 Sexually transmitted infections Background\\ufdd0Infections of the human genito-urinary and reproductive systems transmitted via human sexual contact (sexually transmitted disease, STIs). The most common causes of male urethral discharge are a) the gonococcus Neisseria gonorrhoea and b) Chlamydia trachomatis. The most common causes of male and female genital ulcer are c) syphilis (Treponema pallidum), d) herpes simplex virus (HSV1 or 2) and e) chancroid (Haemophilus ducreyi).\\u2029STIs are endemic in most countries of the world, including countries in Africa. Multiple simultaneous STIs are common (for example, gonorrhoea plus Chlamydia). STIs may be most highly prevalent in areas where HIV occurs and may facilitate HIV transmission. STIs may be primary or from repeated attacks of urethral discharge.\\u2029STIs are a leading cause of abortion and stillbirth, prematurity, and congenital infections. They may lead to pelvic inflammatory disease (PID), a major cause of decreased fertility.\\u2029Incubation periods for gonorrhoea are 2 to 7 days; Chlamydia 7 to 14 days (or longer); syphilis, 10 days to 12 weeks (usually around 3 weeks), and chancroid, 3 to 14 days.\\u2029STIs may be more commonly diagnosed in men, in whom clinical evidence of infection may be more readily apparent.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Early detection and treatment of STI reduces transmission rates. Active efforts to diagnose latent syphilis may prevent significant disability.\\u2029Improve early and effective treatment of STIs using simple algorithms based on syndromic diagnosis for index cases and partners.\\u2029Carry out laboratory-based anti-microbial sensitivity monitoring and modify treatment guidelines accordingly at the national level.\\u2029Compare surveillance data for both STIs and HIV/AIDS since STIs may reflect co-presence of HIV.\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Genital ulcer syndrome (non-vesicular):\\u2029Suspected case: Any male with an ulcer on the penis, scrotum, or rectum, with or without inguinal adenopathy, or any female with ulcer on labia, vagina, or rectum, with or without inguinal adenopathy.\\u2029Confirmed case: Any suspected case confirmed by a laboratory method.\\u2029Urethral discharge syndrome:\\u2029Suspected case: Any male with urethral discharge with or without dysuria.\\u2029Confirmed case: Urethral discharge syndrome: A suspected case confirmed by a laboratory method (for example Gram stain showing intracellular Gram-negative diplococci).\\ufdd0Public health action\\ufdd0Conduct active case finding for specific target groups.\\u2029Conduct primary prevention activities such as promotion of safer sexual behaviours and provision of condoms.\\u2029Assess use of algorithms for detection and treatment of STIs.

UNAIDS/99.33E Smallpox (Variola) NOTE: Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980 and there has been no disease in humans since 1977. Information in this section is provided to educate public health professionals to enable detection of re-emergence and to differentiate smallpox from similar diseases.\\ufdd0Background\\ufdd0Smallpox is an acute contagious disease caused by Variola virus, a member of the Orthopoxvirus genus, Poxviridae family. Other members of the genus that can cause disease in humans include Cowpox virus, Camelpox virus, and Monkeypox virus. Monkeypox virus has caused the most recent human poxvirus infections.\\u2029Smallpox killed up to 30% of those infected and left survivors scarred and sometimes blind. In 1967, when WHO launched an intensified programme to eradicate smallpox, annually there were 10-15 million cases and 2 million deaths globally.\\u2029The global eradication of smallpox was certified by a commission of eminent scientists in December 1979 and subsequently endorsed by the World Health Assembly in 1980.\\u2029The incubation period of smallpox is 12–14 days (range 7–17) during which there is no evidence of viral shedding i.e. the person is not infectious. During this period, the person looks and feels healthy and cannot infect others.\\u2029The disease presents as sudden onset of high fever and other symptoms such as malaise, headache, backache, nausea, vomiting. Two to three days later, the temperature falls and the patient feels somewhat better, at which time the characteristic rash appears, first on the face, hands and forearms and then after a few days progressing to the trunk. Lesions also develop in the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, and ulcerate very soon after their formation, releasing large amounts of virus into the mouth and throat. The centrifugal distribution of lesions, more prominent on the face and extremities than on the trunk, is a distinctive diagnostic feature of smallpox and gives the trained eye cause to suspect the disease. Lesions progress from macules to papules to vesicles to pustules. All lesions in a given area progress together through these stages. From 8 to 14 days after the onset of symptoms, the pustules form scabs which leave depressed depigmented scars upon healing.\\u2029Smallpox had two main forms: variola major and variola minor (the latter was less common). The disease followed a milder course in variola minor, which had a case-fatality rate of less than 1 per cent. The fatality rate of variola major was around 30%. There are two rare forms of severe smallpox: haemorrhagic and malignant. In the former, invariably fatal, the rash was accompanied by haemorrhage into the mucous membranes and the skin. Malignant smallpox was characterized by lesions that did not develop to the pustular stage but remained soft and flat. It was almost invariably fatal.\\u2029Varicella (chickenpox) is often confused with smallpox and can be distinguished from smallpox by its much more superficial lesions, their presence more on the trunk than on the face and extremities, and by the development of successive crops of lesions in the same area. Fever and rash occur simultaneously in chickenpox and develop more rapidly; with death being a rare complication.\\u2029Prior to the eradication of smallpox, human monkeypox virus infections were first reported in human populations in 1970 and may have been misdiagnosed as smallpox due to the similarity of cutaneous presentation and progression. The clinical features of smallpox and human monkeypox are similar; however, smallpox patients do not develop lymphadenopathy which is a prominent clinical sign of monkeypox.  The disease progression through the incubation period, pre-eruptive stage and rash are also similar between the two diseases. Human monkeypox is milder with a lower case fatality ratio (up to 10 %) compared to smallpox (up to 30 %).\\u2029Smallpox is transmitted from person to person by infected aerosols and air droplets spread in direct and fairly prolonged face-to-face contact with an infected person after fever has begun, especially if symptoms include coughing. The disease can also be transmitted by contaminated clothes and bedding, though the risk of infection from this source is much lower.\\u2029The most infectious period is when face-to-face contact occurs with a patient after fever has begun and during the first week of rash, when the virus is released via the respiratory tract. The most at-risk settings are households and health care settings with active cases but spread in the community is low because sick people are bedridden.\\u2029In the absence of immunity induced by vaccination, humans appear to be universally susceptible to infection with the smallpox virus. Since vaccination with smallpox vaccine was discontinued globally after the eradication of smallpox in 1980, most of the world’s population under 40 years of age are not immune and the older age groups have waning immunity.\\u2029WHO maintains smallpox vaccine emergency stockpiles to be deployed in the event of a smallpox re-emergence in order to contain the outbreak. First responders are prioritized to receive the vaccine. Vaccine administered up to 4 days after exposure to the virus, and before the rash appears, provides protective immunity and can prevent infection or ameliorate the severity of the disease.\\u2029Immediate Notification of the occurrence of smallpox cases to WHO is formally required by IHR (2005). The risk of emergence of smallpox is extremely low as the remaining global live variola virus stocks are held in two high security laboratory facilities in Russia and the US and the disease has no animal reservoir.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0To detect and immediately respond to a potential re-emergence or any suspected case of smallpox.

It is caused by infection with Chlamydia trachomatis bacteria, and is both treatable and preventable.\\u2029Infections often begin during infancy or childhood and can become chronic. If left untreated, the infection eventually causes the eyelid to turn inwards, which in turn causes the eyelashes to rub on the eyeball, resulting in intense pain and scarring of the front of the eye. This ultimately leads to irreversible blindness, typically between 30 and 40 years of age.\\u2029Trachoma is easily spread through direct personal contact, shared towels and cloths, and flies that have come in contact with the eyes or nose of an infected person.\\u2029WHO estimates that approximately 6 million cases of blindness due to trachoma and 11 million cases of trichiasis occur worldwide each year. Prevalence of active disease in children varies from 10-40% in some African countries.\\u2029The infection primarily affects young children, with blindness occurring later in life. Females are three times more likely than males to suffer from trichiasis, the in-turning of the eyelashes that can lead to blindness. People are most at risk for trachoma infection in areas where there is poor sanitation, lack of latrines, poor sources of clean water, and the presence of flies.\\u2029Primary interventions advocated for preventing trachoma infection include improved sanitation, reduction of fly breeding sites and increased facial cleanliness (with clean water) among children at risk of disease. The scaring and visual change for trachoma can be reversed by a simple surgical procedure performed at village level which reverses the in-turned eyelashes.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Prevention of blindness by early detection\\u2029Identification of high risk areas and epidemiologic trends\\u2029Estimation of disease burden\\u2029Monitoring of control programs\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case:\\u2029Any patient with red sticky eyes who complains of pain and itchiness of the eyes.\\u2029Confirmed case:\\u2029Any patient with red sticky eyes who complains of pain and itchiness of the eyes where examination of the eyes confirms one of the stages of Trachoma infection according to the WHO Simplified Trachoma Grading System. (see reference below).\\ufdd0Recommended public health action: Trachoma\\ufdd0The World Health Organization has developed a series of interventions to control trachoma known by the acronym SAFE: Surgery, Antibiotics, Facial cleanliness, and Environmental improvement.\\u2029Effective Trachoma control has four main components:\\u2029Eye lid surgery for those at immediate risk of blindness\\u2029Antibiotics to treat individual cases and to reduce infection in a community\\u2029The promotion of facial cleanliness and hygiene to reduce transmission\\u2029Environmental improvements such as provision of water and household sanitation\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time:Monitor epidemiologic trends over time.\\u2029Place:Plot the location of case households and analyse the distribution.\\u2029Person: Analyse the distribution of cases by age and other demographic factors.\\ufdd0Lab confirmation\\ufdd0Routine laboratory confirmation for surveillance is not required.\\ufdd0Diagnostic test\\ufdd0Detection of specific antigen.

In Africa it is caused by the protozoan Trypanosoma burcei rhodesiense and T. b. gambiense, which are transmitted by the bit of infected Glossina (tsetse) flies.\\u2029Trypanosomiasis is endemic in over 30 African countries in West, Central and East Africa. It is highly epidemic in the Democratic Republic of Congo, Angola, and other areas of civil conflict, where 80% of some village populations may be infected. Cattle are the major reservoir of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense, and humans are the major reservoir for T. b. gambiense.\\u2029Incubation period is usually days to weeks with T. b. rhodesiense, and months to years with T. b. gambiense infections. Without treatment, both forms are usually fatal.\\u2029Trypanosomiasis control strategies include human and cattle population surveys to treat infected persons and diminish cattle reservoirs, and tsetse fly habitat control (for example, removal of bushes and tall grasses near villages, and use of residual insecticides).\\u2029Tuberculosis, malaria, bacterial meningitis, HIV/AIDS, and other central nervous system or systemic infections can produce similar clinical findings.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Increase percentage of cases confirmed by laboratory methods.\\u2029Use population-based surveys and serologic screening for active case finding in endemic areas.\\u2029Conduct human and cattle screening in trypanosomiasis-free areas.\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case:\\u2029Early stage: a painful chancre originating as a papule and then evolving into a nodule at the primary fly bite site.

Clinically, the pulmonary form of the disease is more common than the extra-pulmonary form. The cardinal symptoms of pulmonary TB are chronic cough, weight loss, fever, loss of appetite and night sweats.\\u2029Tuberculosis (TB) is a leading cause of infectious illness and death worldwide with over 8 million new cases and 3 million deaths per year. In African countries, approximately 1.6 million of the new cases and over 600 000 cases occur each year. It is also estimated that between 30 and 50% of all new TB cases detected are infected with HIV and 40% of all AIDS deaths are due to TB. Those who are at highest risk of dying from TB include people with HIV/AIDS, malnutrition and other immuno-compromising conditions, the very young, and the very old.\\u2029The global HIV pandemic has been a major cause of increasing TB cases, especially in African countries.\\u2029Incubation period is approximately 1 to 3 months.\\u2029WHO recommends the Directly Observed Therapy, Short-course (DOTS) strategy to maximize compliance and treatment efficacy and to reduce development of drug-resistant strains. The DOTS strategy has been implemented by at least 40 of 46 Member States in the African Region. Varying degrees of success have been achieved in controlling TB where resources and motivation for diagnosis, treatment, and patient follow up are adequate.\\u2029Clinically, bacterial pneumonia, malaria, trypanosomiasis, HIV/AIDS and a variety of other bacterial, parasitic, and viral infections may cause similar syndromes of fever, cough, fatigue, and weight loss, or may themselves precipitate active TB in an already infected individual.

Healthy carrier state may follow acute illness.\\u2029Typhoid fever remains a serious public health problem throughout the world, with an estimated 16–33 million cases and 500 000 to 600 000 deaths annually. \\u2029In virtually all endemic areas, the incidence of typhoid fever is highest in children from 5–19 years old. The disease is almost exclusively transmitted by food and water contaminated by the faeces and urine of patients and carriers.\\u2029Polluted water is the most common source of typhoid transmission. In addition, shellfish taken from sewage-contaminated beds, vegetables fertilized with night-soil and eaten raw, contaminated milk and milk products have been shown to be a source of infection.\\u2029Typhoid fever has been virtually eliminated in most areas of the industrialized world with the advent of proper sanitary facilities. Most cases in developed countries are imported from endemic countries.\\u2029People can transmit the disease as long as the bacteria remain in their body; most people are infectious prior to and during the first week of convalescence, but 10% of untreated patients will discharge bacteria for up to 3 months.\\u2029Typhoid fever can be treated with antibiotics. However, resistance to common antimicrobials is widespread. Healthy carriers should be excluded from handling food.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Detect Typhoid Fever sporadic cases and outbreaks promptly, and seek laboratory verification\\u2029Identify areas/population at high risk in order to improve prevention of the disease by taking hygienic measures\\ufdd0Standard case definitions\\ufdd0Suspected case: Any person with gradual onset of steadily increasing and then persistently high fever, chills, malaise, headache, sore throat, cough, and, sometimes, abdominal pain and constipation or diarrhoea.\\u2029Confirmed case: Suspected case confirmed by isolation of Salmonella typhi from blood, bone marrow, bowel fluid or stool.

It is the willingness to call an alert about uncertain and worrying events that is the sign of a functional public health system. \\u2029By their nature these events cannot be precisely described but scenarios have been used to help illustrate what might raise concern. The IHR regulations contain a \"decision instrument\" to guide WHO members (Refer to Section 2 of these guidelines). A \"yes\" answer to any two of the following four questions means that an event potentially constitutes a public health emergency of international concern that the WHO member must notify to WHO: (1) Is the public health impact of the event serious? (2) Is the event unusual or unexpected? (3) Is there a significant risk of international spread? (4) Is there a risk of restrictions on international travel or trade?\\u2029The report that there is a possible outbreak or unusual event may come from different sources including: \\u2029routine analysis of surveillance data (e.g. from routine reporting indicates an unexpected increase in cases of a notifiable disease \\u2029a health worker (doctor, nurse or CHA, Environmental health Technician (EHT)) who reports a cluster of patients with a certain disease at their HCF or in the community \\u2029a community leader who notices an unusual health event in their community and reports it to the authorities \\u2029Continued reporting of these events from the local level are contingent on the willingness of the district, County/Regional and National levels to listen and give credibility to the local levels. The responsiveness of the system to these alerts will define the likelihood that they will be reported and vigilance continues. \\u2029A literature review into the important obstacles for reporting Public Health Events of International concern found the following: \\u2029Lack of knowledge among clinicians of the reporting process, including not knowing what diseases are reportable and not knowing what to report. Often there is confusion over who is responsible for reporting between the hospital and laboratory as well as confusion over whether laboratory confirmation is required prior to reporting. \\u2029A lack of understanding of how information acquired through reporting is used and a perception that reporting diseases is a useless endeavour. \\u2029The effect of actual or perceived negative consequences associated with reporting, such as extra work, intrusive requests for further information, media attention, judgment, punishment or blame, was stressed as an obstacle by multiple respondents. \\u2029Strategies to enhance completeness of notifiable disease reporting and IHR events include the following: \\u2029Provide clear information to frontline staff about \\u2029Why report unusual events? \\u2029What events are reportable? \\u2029How to report an unusual event? \\u2029What happens after you report? \\u2029Examples of event reporting:\\u2029Strengthen the ability to ask questions and get immediate feedback between clinicians and other key partners to encourage more complete reporting, such as by providing access to public health professionals in the case of emergencies and establishing a 24-hour toll free phone number for reporting. \\u2029More frequent field visits or phone conferences can help as well. \\u2029Feedback to clinicians and others in the reporting chain, showing them that preventative action is being taken as a result of their notification, helps emphasize the need for timely and complete reporting. Providing feedback to those reporting could increase trust and transparency in the exchange of information about unusual events, improve the perception of how reported information is used and demonstrate the consequences of not reporting \\u2029All surveillance is built on good personal relationships or knowledge of the individuals involved in reporting. Encourage relationship building.  \\u2029How reported information is handled: \\u2029The IHR has national focal points that contact their counterparts at WHO regional Offices. These regional offices enter epidemiological and other information necessary for risk analysis and management into an event management system that stores the information and makes it available. Feedback to countries through a national IHR focal point completes the reporting link and, if countries require support in outbreak response, a request is transmitted back to the WHO.\\u2029This most recent guidance from WHO/AFRO focuses on Public Health Events (PHE) of initially unknown aetiology, which are PHEs for which the cause has not yet been determined. For such events, the One Health approach is recommended, where the ministry of health works in close collaboration with other ministries and multi-sectoral partners to enhance teamwork and improve efficiencies in preparedness, response, and monitoring and evaluation (M&E).\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0The assessment of whether an event may potentially be of international significance occurs at the national level, guided by Annex 2 of the IHR (2005) which is not intended to be used sub-nationally. \\u2029In this definition of an “event” or death sensitivity is prioritized to facilitate reporting and to reduce delays, emphasizing the fact that there should be no negative consequences f\\\\or a potentially false signal. \\u2029Detect cases. \\u2029Immediate case-based reporting of all cases. Weekly summary reporting of cases for routine surveillance and outbreaks. Standard case definition \\ufdd0These events are not well detailed or standardized at this time.

It is a zoonotic disease transmitted from birds to humans and other animals. Serological evidence suggests that the infection is present throughout practically the entire African continent. West Nile Fever most likely emerged in Africa and is now found world-wide. Outbreaks occur in humans, birds and horses.\\u2029Most cases are mild and may not come to the attention of the health system. Patients seeking health care usually present with flu-like symptoms such as fever, headache and body aches. Occasionally patients present with a skin rash on the neck, trunk, arms or legs.\\u2029People of all ages and conditions may be affected. However, those who are above age 50 years or who have had an organ transplant are at increased risk of severe illness.\\u2029Very severe cases include signs of encephalitis, meningo-encephalitis or meningitis. Symptoms include high fever, headache, neck stiffness, stupor, tremors, convulsions, flaccid paralysis and coma.\\u2029The case fatality rate in patients with neurological involvement ranges from 4% to 14% and as high as 29% in elderly patients.\\u2029West Nile Fever can be prevented by avoiding mosquito bites especially at dusk when mosquitoes are most active. Insect repellents, wearing long sleeves and trousers, staying indoors and draining breeding sites like pools of standing water can reduce exposure to mosquitoes.\\u2029Confirmation of West Nile Fever in patients with clinical symptoms requires laboratory confirmation of specific IgM antibodies in cerebrospinal fluid and serum specimens.\\u2029Because there is no specific treatment for West Nile Fever, patients with severe disease are usually hospitalized for supportive treatment and nursing care.\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Identify risk factors for infection and determine high-risk populations for targeted prevention activities\\u2029Identify geographic areas for targeted prevention and control activities\\u2029Identify most severe cases for referral to hospitalized care\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\ufdd0Suspected case:\\u2029A hospitalized case of encephalitis due to unknown cause\\u2029Confirmed case:\\u2029Confirmation of West Nile Fever is through laboratory diagnostics to identify WNV-specific IgM West Nile Fever Respond to alert threshold\\ufdd0If a single case is suspected:\\u2029Report case-based information immediately to the appropriate levels.\\u2029Treat and manage the patient with supportive care.\\u2029Collect specimen safely to confirm the case.\\ufdd0Respond to action threshold\\ufdd0If a single case is confirmed:\\u2029Treat and manage the patient with supportive care\\u2029Mobilise the community through education in order to promote adoption of behaviours that reduce disease risk such as protection against mosquito bites and reduction of mosquito breeding sites\\u2029Conduct community education on how WNV is transmitted and on how to prevent being infected\\ufdd0Analyse and interpret data\\ufdd0Time:Construct an epidemic curve during the outbreak.\\u2029Place:Plot location of case residence and worksite.\\u2029Person:Immediate case-based reporting of cases and deaths.

Plenum Medical Book Company, New York\\u2029 Yaws and endemic syphilis or bejel Background\\ufdd0Endemic trepanometoses in the WHO African Region include two Neglected Tropical Diseases caused by two different sub species of Treponema pallidum (T.p.): yaws, due to T. p. pertenue and bejel caused by T. p. pallidum\\u2029Yaws initially presents as a papilloma teemed with bacteria (primary yaws). The papilloma is a typical presentation of yaws and clinical diagnosis is straightforward. Without treatment, the papilloma will ulcerate. Papilloma and ulcers are very infectious and in the absence of treatment can quickly spread to other persons. Other clinical forms of yaws exist but they are not very infectious. Apart of papilloma and ulcers, other lesions of yaws and bejel range from macules, papules, nodules, plaques to secondary yaws that occurs weeks to months after the primary infection and typically presents with multiple raised yellow lesions or pain and swelling of long bones and fingers (dactylitis). \\u2029Yaws spreads in inter-tropical areas, in humid and warm zones such as equatorial rain forests and their surroundings, while bejel is found in most dry and arid regions such as the Sahel trip \\u2029Children from 2 to 14 years old are the most affected age-group, especially in school-age children where outbreaks of yaws or bejel could be observed\\u2029Yaws treatment which was based on single injection of long lasting penicillin (benzathine benzyl penicillin) has improved greatly by the confirmation of the efficacy of a single dose of Azithromycin for curing yaws lesion in 2010. Further to this confirmation, the WHO has designed a yaws eradication strategy, titled “The Morges Strategy” from the name of a city near Geneva, where the Strategy was drafted in 2012. This eradication strategy consists mainly in mass administration of azithromycin (MAA) to at-risk communities and achieving at least 90% coverage of targeted populations\\u2029The mode of transmission is through direct contact with skin lesions or items already contaminated by primary lesions (papilloma and ulcers) \\u2029Confirmation of diagnosis is done by dual treponemal and non-treponemal rapid tests, a syphilis test which is not specific for yaws followed by a dual path platform (DPP) test which is specific for T. p; pertenue. These rapid tests can be performed in the fields and are able to detect recent and past infections\\ufdd0Surveillance goal\\ufdd0Yaws is targeted for eradication by 2020, eradication being defined as complete interruption of transmission (zero new case of yaws) globally. The surveillance goals are to 1) ensure detection of any new case of yaws in a given area for implementing the eradication strategy and 2) after stopping transmission, maintain active case search for at least three years to certify yaws eradication\\ufdd0Standard case definition\\u2029\\u2029Suspected case: a person with a history of residence in an endemic area (past or present) who presents with clinically active (visible) yaws lesions\\u2029Confirmed case: a suspected case with a positive serological test (rapid treponemal test for syphilis confirmed by DPP test)\\u2029Imported case: a person who presents with clinically active yaws serologically confirmed in an area where yaws is not known to be endemic\\u2029Index case: first case of yaws which is detected in a community \\u2029Contact of a case: a person who has close, frequent contact with the infected person.

Brazzaville, Congo, from 13 to 15 October 2010\\u2029 Zika virus disease Background \\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Zika virus is a flavivirus that is transmitted primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito, primarily Aedes aegypti, and also Aedes albopictus, the same mosquitoes that transmit dengue, chikungunya, and yellow fever.\\u2029Zika virus can also be transmitted in-utero from mother to fetus, and through sexual contact, blood transfusion, and organ transplantation. \\u2029Zika virus infections are usually asymptomatic. When symptoms occur, they tend to be mild and include mild fever, rash, conjunctivitis, and muscle and joint pain that last for 2 to 7 days. There is no specific treatment but symptoms can be treated with common fever medicines, rest and drinking fluids.   \\u2029Zika virus infection during pregnancy can result in preterm birth, fetal loss, stillbirth, and congenital malformations including microcephaly, limb contractures, eye abnormalities, brain calcifications, and other manifestations of Congenital Zika Syndrome.   \\u2029Zika virus is also associated with an increased risk of Guillain-Barré syndrome, and other neurological complications requiring close medical management and possibly intensive care and mechanical ventilation.\\u2029\\u2029History\\u2029Zika virus was first identified in 1947 in a rhesus monkey the Zika forest of Uganda, and was first identified in humans in 1952 in Uganda and the United Republic of Tanzania. Over the following decades, Zika virus caused rare, sporadic cases of disease in Africa and Asia, generally causing mild and self-limited illness of fever, rash, malaise, and other mild symptoms. \\u2029The first outbreaks were reported in Yap Island (Federated States of Micronesia) in 2007 and French Polynesia in 2013. The virus subsequently spread to other Pacific islands including New Caledonia, Cook Islands, Vanuatu and Easter Island (Chile), Fiji, Samoa, Solomon Islands, and Vanuatu. Zika virus was not known to cause severe disease until the 2013-2014 outbreak in French Polynesia, where increased incidence of Guillain-Barré Syndrome was first reported. \\u2029The Zika virus outbreak in the Region of the Americas began in Brazil in 2015; in July 2015, Brazil reported an association between Zika virus infection and Guillain-Barré syndrome (GBS) and few months later, in October 2015, an association between Zika virus infection and microcephaly.\\u2029Since 2015, outbreaks of Zika virus disease have now been recorded in Africa, the Americas, Asia and the Pacific; to date, 86 countries and territories have confirmed evidence of mosquito-borne  Zika transmission.  Since 2017, Zika virus transmission in the Americas has waned, but transmission continues with intermittent areas of emergence and re-emergence.\\u2029In the African Region, only rare, sporadic Zika virus infection had been reported until 2015. Since 2015, outbreaks of Zika virus have been reported in Cabo Verde, Guinea-Bissau, and Angola.\\u2029There are two strains of Zika virus known as the African and Asian strains. The Asian strain was associated with the outbreaks in the Pacific and in the Americas. The Asian strain was also identified in the Cabo Verde outbreak and in Angola. In Angola, a cluster of microcephaly was reported in 2017-2018, and introduction of the epidemic (Brazilian) Asian strain was confirmed, including among infants born with microcephaly. To date, microcephaly has only been identified following infection with the Asian strain. Little information is available on the spectrum of disease and pregnancy risk associated with the African strain.\\u2029Aedes mosquitoes that transmit Zika, dengue, yellow fever, and chikungunya primarily bite during daylight hours.  Aedes sp. breed in small collections of water such as in trash, used tyres, flower pots, and open water storage containers. Efforts to prevent transmission focus on elimination of these breeding sites around homes and near other areas of human-vector contact such as around schools and work sites. Other prevention strategies include use of personal protection measures such as use of protective clothing, insect repellent, and screens on windows and doors.\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Surveillance goals\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0The goal of surveillance is to develop, strengthen and implement integrated surveillance systems at all levels for Zika virus disease, its complications, and other arboviral diseases and their vectors, in order to provide up-to-date and accurate epidemiological and entomological information to guide response.\\u2029Existing surveillance systems should be enhanced for early detection and reporting of Zika virus and unusual clusters of neurological disorders or birth defects. \\u2029Timely notification of any event compatible with Zika virus is important, and in particular any associated with neurological disorders and neonatal malformations through established channels, including IHR.\\u2029The establishment or strengthening of event-based or syndromic surveillance should be supported, potentially targeting specific groups for surveillance, such as pregnant women through antenatal and postnatal care, sentinel based surveillance systems for birth defects and Guillain-Barré syndrome, and existing lab-based disease specific surveillance systems (e.g. measles, polio) to facilitate detection of Zika virus infection and associated disorders. Given the common vector and epidemiologic transmission patterns of dengue, Zika, and chikungunya calls for an integrated arbovirus surveillance.\\u2029\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Standard case definitions\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0\\ufdd0Suspected Case: \\u2029A person presenting with rash and/or fever and at least

Sampling of Aedes mosquitoes, pupae and oviposition should be conducted. \\u2029As part of entomological surveillance, insecticide resistance monitoring in field populations of Aedes should be conducted to identify and select the appropriate insecticides. \\u2029\\u2029NB:  Application of strategic intervention in different country contexts:\\u2029The described interventions will be packaged and applied in countries depending on the context. In countries where there is the spread of Zika virus as well as the associated complications, a full suite of strategies will be applied from enhanced surveillance, engaging communities, vector control and personal protective measures, care for people with complications and public health research to better understand risk and evaluate mitigation measures.\\u2029For countries are already experiencing widespread Zika transmission or presence of Aedes vectors, enhanced surveillance should be put in place, communities engaged, and vector control and personal protective measures enhanced.\\u2029For all other countries, risk communications for the public regarding trade and travel will be the main line of engagement.

Listing each case and their information will help provide the data needed to assess characteristics of cases to help guide response activities. This is an important tool to collect information and analyse quickly.  During an outbreak, the line list must be established and used as a primary data collection tool. The columns under the IDSR Line List should be changed based on the situation. The information from each reported case should be added to a single row in the spreadsheet. This paper form should be routinely incorporated in the IDSR Routinely Reported Database to facilitate comprehensive analysis and reporting to next level daily as well as on weekly basis.

Eradication: the confirmed absence of clinical manifestations (the interruption of transmission of Dracunculus medinensis in human and animal) for three years or longer at the global level. (2)  Testing should be according to local guidance for management of community‐acquired pneumonia. Examples of other aetiologies include Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type B, Legionella pneumophila, other recognized primary bacterial pneumonias, influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus. (3)  For a map of the Middle East, see: http://www.un.org/Depts /Cartographic/map/profile/mideastr.pdf (4)  A ‘cluster’ is defined as two or more persons with onset of symptoms within the same 14 day period, and who are associated with a specific setting such as a classroom, workplace, household, extended family, hospital, other residential institution, military barracks or recreational camp. (5) Close contact’ is defined as: Health care associated exposure, including providing direct care for MERS‐CoV patients, working with health care workers infected with MERS‐CoV, visiting patients or staying in the same close environment of a MERS‐CoV patient. Working together in close proximity or sharing the same classroom environment with a with MERSCoV patient Traveling together with MERS‐CoV patient in any kind of conveyance Living in the same household as a MERS‐CoV patient The epidemiological link may have occurred within a 14‐day period before or after the onset of illness in the case under consideration.',\n",
